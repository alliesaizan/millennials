This repository contains the programming scripts that cleaned the data behind the Pudding article named "The Millennial Question", published in October 2019. The finished article can be found here: https://pudding.cool/2019/09/millennials/. The data cleaning process involved three steps:
  1. Extracting articles about Millennials using an API
  2. Using NLP methods such as part-of-speech tagging to further categorize scraped articles and identify sentence objects 
  3. Transforming the text data into a multilevel structure for JavaScript parsing
To view the data cleaning process used for that story, open the Jupyter notebook named "Articles Processing Script (Formatted)".
