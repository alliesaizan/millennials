Not all millennials who still live with their parents are immature,http://nypost.com/2017/04/23/not-all-millennials-who-still-live-with-their-parents-are-immature/,"According to the four ""common milestones"" of adulthood, I'm not there yet.

And I'm not the only millennial supposedly falling behind.

A new report from the US Census Bureau looking at the state of young adults in America identifies ""four common milestones of adulthood"" as ""getting married, having children, working, and living independently."" In 1975, 45 percent of those between the ages of 25 and 34 had achieved all four. Now, it's down to 24 percent.

Millennials just won't grow up, right? Not quite. Maybe millennials are coursing a different path precisely because they want to do ""adulting"" well.

Living with your parents because you want free food and rent while you play video games in the basement is a disgrace. Living with your parents because you're saving to start a business or want to foster a close relationship shouldn't be embarrassing.

Ditto with other life choices. I'm not married because I value marriage: I'm waiting until I meet a guy I could realistically see myself spending the rest of my life with. And since I think children deserve to have a mom and a dad, I'm not going to rush into parenthood before marriage.

But having spent the past eight years of my life taking responsibility for my actions, making my own decisions in accordance with my goals and my values -- and, yes, assembling Ikea furniture -- I think I'm a grown-up, milestones be damned.

Because ultimately these milestones harshly limit the kind of life you can lead. For instance, my twentysomething brother, who is studying to be a Catholic priest, is on course to never ""achieve"" getting married and having children -- and his vow of poverty guarantees he'll never be boasting about financial independence.

But he's gearing up to spend a lifetime in prayer and helping men and women grow closer to God. That's hardly a sign of immaturity.

And it's easy to think of other cases where a person's goals make those ""milestones"" irrelevant: consciously choosing to focus, for a time, on a career that doesn't easily allow the work-life balance required for both men and women to be fair to one's family; spending months or years volunteering; forgoing financial independence, with Mom and Dad's approval, to pursue a start-up dream.

Of course, none of this makes those milestones not worth pursuing -- if that's what you want. Several of my friends married in their early 20s, and it's been a joy to see them set their own path and to watch their children grow up. And personally, I've loved financial independence, living on my own and having a career I've relished.

There's another problem with the Census criteria for adulthood: Many millennials might be making their life choices not out of convenience but necessity. Living at home because you want to be close to your parents is great; living at home because you can't afford to pay student loans without doing that isn't so great -- but it doesn't make you immature.

Ditto for those living at home because they can't find a job or a good-enough paying job -- possibly a consequence of higher minimum wages making it harder for young adults to score that vital first job.

On the relationships front, it's one thing to forgo marriage because you're determined to meet the right person in order to avoid divorce. It's another matter if marriage is being avoided because our culture's porn habits have made young adults less capable of intimacy, of the true vulnerability crucial to relationships -- or because they're determined to hold out, no matter how many years it takes to rack up the savings, to have a wedding all their social media ""friends"" will swoon over.

Likewise with children (a not-insignificant concern, given the declining US birth rate): If young adults are delaying because they've been scared by the outrageous standards and expectations fostered by our helicopter-parenting culture or by the intimidating cost projections of having kids that never seem to prominently include the fact that those costs per child can decline with more kids, thanks to bedroom sharing and hand-me-downs, that's a shame.

Yet ultimately, a new openness to what it means to be an adult could help liberate people to pursue their best lives. We all have different gifts and talents, leading to a variety of career and volunteering paths -- and while marriage and raising children is wonderful, cultivating richer relationships with friends, extended family and, yes, one's parents can bring their own joys.

Maybe the most ""adult"" realization of millennials is that it's nonsense to measure maturity by these milestones.",2017-04-24,not all millennials who still live with their parents are immature,Not all millennials who still live with their parents are immature,"['live', 'are']",['their parents'],"['millennials', 'who', 'are']",1.0
The new season of 'survivor' will pit generation x against millennials in a feud of stereotypes,http://uproxx.com/tv/survivor-trailer-millennials-vs-gen-x/,"When CBS announced in March that its long-running reality television series Survivor would return for a 33rd season in the fall, absolutely no one was surprised. Or at least nobody should have been, because host Jeff Probst's cash cow will live on forever and always, long after the rest of the viewing population dies during the post-apocalyptic nuclear winter finally dissipates. (Survivor will squeeze at least 10 seasons out of the fallout.) This is especially true for show's themed runs, the latest of witch pits equally whiny members of Generation X and the current plague of Millennials against one another.

According to Team Gen X's Chris, ""It's hard work. It's not how fast I can type it on Google and find the answer. The Millennials, they don't have a clue what their life is going to be like or what they're doing. They don't have a plan. They certainly haven't been battle-tested. If you haven't ever been knocked down, then you don't know how to get up and fight.""

Never fear, Team Millennials, because Taylor is here to defend your honor with quips about ""older generations."" Like his argument that ""they've been brainwashed with this, 'You have to have a career. You have to do A, B, C, D.' I'm a free man. I don't like to be caged. You can do whatever the hell you want. I'm going to go do it. #SoulSurvivor.""

Has this pastor 'discovered the secret' to reaching millennials?,http://www.mailtribune.com/news/20160920/has-this-pastor-discovered-secret-to-reaching-millennials?rssfeed=true,"Some churches in the District of Columbia have uncovered the ""secret"" to reaching millennials -- or so proclaims the headline of a recent Washington Post story.

The District Church, a house of worship in Washington led by 36-year-old pastor Aaron Graham, is the primary church mentioned in the piece, as Graham is among the faith leaders who have successfully courted young adults living in the capital.

In fact, the church, which sees around 600 parishioners attend on Sundays, is primarily composed of millennials -- individuals between the ages of 18 and 33.

For anyone paying attention, this is a notable feat, considering that much has been said about the tendency of America's young adults to be less religiously affiliated than their predecessors.

Graham's apparent success comes as many churches cope with the task of courting a millennial generation that seems less and less engaged.

Just two years ago, the Pew Research Center found that the proportion of Americans who called themselves ""nones"" -- those who are either atheist, agnostic or unaffiliated with a faith -- increased from 16.1 percent to 22.8 percent between 2007 and 2014.

Among millennials who were born between 1981 and 1996, though, this proportion was even higher at 35 percent. To put that into perspective, more millennials reject a religious label than identify as evangelicals (21 percent), Catholics (16 percent) or mainline Protestants (11 percent), according to Pew.

It's not only about labels, though, as perceptions and practices also paint a picture in which millennials are less devout than earlier generations. Only 41 percent say religion is very important to them, just 27 percent attend church weekly, and only 52 percent are absolutely certain that God exists.

The key question, of course, is, ""Why?""

Some might point to an increasingly secular culture, though New York University sociology professor Michael Hout has speculated that millennials were raised by baby boomers who emphasized the importance of critical thinking, leading to a ""do-it-yourself"" mentality on faith.

It's important to note that there are also indications that millennials are even less religious at this point in their lives than were members of earlier generations, and that matters -- at least when it comes to overarching demographics.

Dr. Jessica Martinez, a research associate at Pew, told TheBlaze it seems something called ""generational replacement"" is at play.

""This generation is much more religiously unaffiliated than older generations,"" she said. ""As the younger are replacing older, it's shifting the landscape in this way.""

So, getting back to the District Church, let's briefly explore how Graham appears to be courting millennials.

As a nondenominational Christian house of worship, District Church is ""intentionally multicultural"" and emphasizes doing good works in the community, while also embracing what the Post called ""unfiltered evangelism.""

Graham said he believes many young people are engaged with their faith but the church experience must feel authentic and truly reach them at their core.

""My dream is that when young people think about changing the world, they'll think about doing it with a local church,"" he told the Post. ""They'll have a theology about how to treat people, about where it all fits.""

District Church is like other houses of worship in Washington, such as Grace Capital City, Triumph Church and The Table in that the experience at each is participatory in nature, bringing members into the worship process.

Small groups -- tiny gatherings of like-minded believers where people discuss scripture and life -- are also used.

Since Pew's millennial results were made public, many have issued tips for churches looking to attract millennials. Interestingly, some of these tips square nicely with what Graham, among others, are doing at their churches.

Some recommendations include allowing for leadership roles for young people, being authentic and employing small groups.

Experts like Ed Stetzer, executive director of the Billy Graham Center for Evangelism at Wheaton College, have also dived deep into tactics about how to reach -- and retain -- millennials.

""The first clear pattern among churches that are reaching young adults is that they tend to be more contemporary,"" he wrote in a 2014 blog post. ""They are engaged with culture and are aware of societal trends, helping young adults think through their context with discerning, biblical eyes.""

Like others, Stetzer emphasized being authentic and caring for the downtrodden and outcasts.

""One of the best ways to find out how to reach millennials is to get to know them,"" he wrote. ""Talk with those in their 20s and early 30s. Discover their likes and dislikes. Ask for their input. Actually befriend them.""",2016-09-25,has this pastor 'discovered the secret' to reaching millennials?,Has this pastor 'discovered the secret' to reaching millennials?,"['Has', 'discovered', 'reaching']","['the secret', 'millennials']","['pastor', 'discovered']",0.0
What's the password? millennials among leaders in getting streaming tv for free,http://www.mercurynews.com/whats-the-password-millennials-among-leaders-in-getting-streaming-tv-for-free,"It's no secret that people would rather get something for free than pay for it. And faced with the possibility of paying $10.99 a month for Netflix or getting it for nothing, it should come as no surprise that someone might want to use another person's password to log in and binge on the latest season of ""Orange Is The New Black.""

And when it comes to password sharing for streaming TV services, millennials lead the way in getting something for nothing. That's according to the results of a study on streaming-video watching habits from media and entertainment research firm Magid.

The 2018 Magid Video Entertainment Survey, which included 2,000 Americans from the ages of 8 to 64, showed that when it comes to millienials, 26 percent of the group uses the password from someone else's account to watch shows on a streaming TV service such as Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime Video. Magid defines millennials as consumers between the ages of 22 and 40.

But, even more than millennials, those in the 18-to-21 age bracket like to stream their TV shows with the password of someone paying for the service, with 27 percent of the group, which Magid calls ""Adult Plurals"", doing so.

Jill Rosengard Hill, of Magid, said the high rate of streaming TV password sharing among millennials is indicative of what she called the ""shared economy,"" in which participants of a group try to save money and help out their friends at the same time.

""For them, it's no different than having their parents pay for their insurance or their cell phone,"" Hill said. ""What many do is someone will subscribe to Netflix, while someone else will subscribe to Hulu, and they will swap passwords with each other. That way, they can say they are each paying for something.""

Hill said he concept of password sharing is definitely more in vogue with younger streaming TV viewers. The Magid study showed 10 percent of Gen Xers, those between the ages of 41 and 51, share streaming TV passwords, while just 8 percent of Baby Boomers do so.

One of the ongoing questions involving password sharing is how much money the likes of Netflix and Hulu are losing in the process. Netflix allows for five individual profiles with one paid account, while a Hulu account can have up to six profiles. However, the multi-profile feature is intended to be used by different members of the same family so that they can watch shows they prefer. Sharing passwords with friends, or others not under the same roof, is a different matter.

""How much money is its worth?' asked Hill. ""It's really hard to say. But it's going to be a bigger question as more and more streaming TV services become available.""",2018-08-21,what's the password? millennials among leaders in getting streaming tv for free,What's the password?

Millennials mad at this advert,http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/90395459/Sleep-deprivation-is-your-drug-of-choice-Fiverrs-UK-campaign-criticised,"People have been angered by a campaign they feel glorifies work-life struggles.

A poster aimed at young freelancers has been accused of promoting unhealthy work-life.

The advert by Fiverr, a website where freelancers can offer services, reads: ""You eat a coffee for lunch. You follow through on your follow through. Sleep deprivation is your drug of choice. You might be a doer.""

The poster is part of a campaign that Fiverr is continuing to push forward. The In Doers We Trust project portrays professionals in the gig economy as overworked, rather than hardworking, struggling with poor job security as a result of part time jobs and apps, Attn reports.

But people took to Twitter to express how they really felt about the campaign.

Fiverr's global head of digital, Chris Lane, explained to Attn that the poster was part of a well thought-out and researched campaign for its community and their mindsets.

""We want people to get out of their comfort zones, challenge them to think about their lives and if they are doing everything they can to achieve success.The storytelling pushes against bureaucratic over thinking, analysis-paralysis, and the kind of excessive white boarding too many of us associate with corporate meeting rooms all over the world.

Millennials will be parents living in suburbs by time midtown east is ready for redevelopment,https://therealdeal.com/2017/07/20/millennials-will-be-parents-living-in-suburbs-by-time-midtown-east-is-ready-for-redevelopment/,"If Council approves proposal, only 3 sites suitable to develop in near future: Cushman

The City Council's Committee on Land Use is set to vote next week on the proposal to rezone 78 blocks in Midtown East, which is projected to create 6.5 million square feet of new office space over the next two decades.

Should the committee approve the plan and the full Council give the final thumbs up in August, however, only a small handful of the 16 sites the city's identified for redevelopment could get started in the near term.

""Of those 16, many of them have multiple ownership, the single ownership properties have 20, 30 [or] 40 tenants in the building with various lease expirations so they're not being vacated anytime soon,"" Bob Knakal, chair of New York investment sales at Cushman & Wakefield, said at the brokerage's midyear media breakfast Thursday.

Knakal said there are only three sites that are suitable for redevelopment in the next three to five years: the W hotel at 541 Lexington Avenue, Pfizer's two properties at 218 and 235 East 42nd Street and the InterContinental Barclay Hotel at 11 East 48th Street, which just underwent a $180 million renovation.

""The fact is, if the Midtown rezoning passes next week, it will tangibly impact the market in 2027 to 2037,"" he said.

But that might just be the right timing for a resurgence around Grand Central Terminal.

Cushman executive vice chair Dale Schlather said that 10 to 20 years is when millennials will be moving out of the city into the suburbs, which will once again drive demand for office space back into the Plaza District.",2017-07-24,millennials will be parents living in suburbs by time midtown east is ready for redevelopment,Millennials will be parents living in suburbs by time Midtown East is ready for redevelopment,"['will', 'be', 'living', 'is']","['suburbs', 'time', 'redevelopment']","['millennials', 'be', 'east']",1.0

Millennials at work don't see themselves as millennials,http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/2069487-millennials-at-work-dont-see-themselves-as-millennials/,"Reading the headlines on Gen Y, Gen X, and millennials it's clear many people believe distinct generational categories exist, that there are very real differences between them, and that organizations must manage these differences. Others write articles claiming there is battle raging between one generation and another.

But there is very little empirical evidence to substantiate most claims about generational differences. In fact, an increasing amount of work published in recent years has begun to question the veracity of generational research.

Young professionals are often expected to start first, work through lunch, leave last, and yet get paid the least. Despite this, critique of youth is a recurring pattern throughout Western history. While many people born before 1980 seem ready to bemoan the apparent shortcomings of millennials, or those ""bloody Gen Ys,"" they seem to forget that people said the same thing about them when they were growing up.

So it becomes important to ask, when people are talking about ""kids these days,"" are they really talking about the kids, or are they taking part in a millennia-old tradition of criticizing youth? And amid all the chatter, why is it that the one group of people who are (somewhat ironically) not asked to figure out what it means to be young at work, is the young at work?

Last year I spent three months interviewing young professionals in the advertising industry in Sydney, Australia, about what age and generations meant to them at work.

Interviews were framed as a discussion about their experiences and perspectives of being young in the industry. In the later stages of the interview, I would ask participants if they were familiar with the term ""generations"" and asked them what it meant to them.

I found that while young professionals knew that people categorized them as millennials, or Gen Ys, and they knew that these were categories they fell into, they did not see themselves as millennials or Gen Ys. This was the case for many participants. One was Kathryn, who when asked if she had heard the term generation and what it meant to her replied:

""That term annoys me because I am supposed to be Gen Y and if you read everything that is about Gen Y then it's not really how I see myself, and I don't like the fact that you have the boxes you have to fit in.""

Kathryn's response was similar to many participants who saw generational categories, such as Gen Y or millennials as a quite negative stereotype.

Participants who said they were familiar with generational archetypes were asked whether they associated or identified themselves with a generation. Participants such as Christine explained how in the context of work, the most important thing was attitude, personality, and how you treat others.

""No, I think more important than generation is or, I guess, more important than an age, or being defined by your age is your behavior and I mean, and I think whether you are coming into a new job at 20, or 30, or 50, I think it's more about the way you present yourself and your attitudes towards the job more that, that has more impact on anyone than age, personally, that's my personal opinion. And I mean, that is always the way that I have always tried to sort of portray myself, I don't portray myself as this young, 20 year old that has no idea what I want to do, you know I, I work hard to prove myself, and you know, and I think people look more favorably at that.""

Interestingly, participants like Christine alluded to the concern about being labelled as young, which could undermine their credibility. Because of this, many actively worked to avoid portraying themselves as such.

Almost all of participants expressed similar sentiment, that while they knew other people considered them a Gen Y, this was not who they felt they were -- they just wanted to work hard, prove themselves, and be a part of a team.

While this study was only small, the data would suggest that, at the very least, not all millennials are millennials as we think we know them.

We had millennials try chick-fil-a for the first time,http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-try-chick-fil-a-first-time-taste-test-2018-5,"Chick-fil-A is a fan favorite among many for fast food restaurants. The biggest location in NYC opened right near the Insider Inc. office, so we fed some millennials who have never tried the chain's food. Following is a transcript of the video.

Katie Warren: I never tried Chick-fil-A because there weren't any where I grew up in Montana.

Sophie-Claire Hoeller: I grew up in Europe. I don't think there is a single Chick-fil-A in Europe, so...

Fabiana Buontempo: I am expecting this to be the best fast food meal that I've ever had.

Callie Ahlgrim: I feel like it has this weird cult following on Twitter. I want to be blown away.

Abby Tang: I think it's just going to be fine.

Sophie-Claire Hoeller: I'm expecting a delicious chicken sandwich that will hopefully change my life because there are so many people obsessed with Chick-fil-A.

Jen Osaki: Ooh, this is a nice bag. Oh! My sandwich kind of already fell apart. It's kind of deflated, but it's nice because it doesn't look like a McDonald's patty, where it's like a pulverized chicken patty.

Sophie-Claire Hoeller: It's very squishy bread. I don't like that already.

Nick Fernandez: It smells like cafeteria food that I had in elementary school. This is a very sad chicken sandwich. I don't know how I feel about this. Everybody's been raving about Chick-fil-A and I'm just sitting here like, ""Mmm, I don't know.""

The Taste Test

Jen Osaki: Mmm... That's surprising! There's like a little bit of a crunch. But the chicken itself is kind of salty.

María González Romero: Overall taste, I would say good. Texture, I did not like that much. I like the sauce.

Callie Ahlgrim: The pickles and the bun have a very distinct Big Mac flavor. I don't really like hamburgers, but I've had a Big Mac, and it's not that great.

Jen Atalla: This is way better than what I was expecting.

Olivia Singh: I'm not really a fan of pickles. But I think the amount in this sandwich is pretty good.

Jen Atalla: Here, let's just look at these beautiful fries. These fries are way better than other fast food fries.

Nick Fernandez: The fries aren't bad. They're pretty good. They're not too salty for me. They're very standard fries.

María González Romero: [laughing] I don't like them.

Sophie-Claire Hoeller: I'm a big fan of soggy McDonald's fries and these are a little crispier. They're okay. They're a little potato-y for me.

Olivia Singh: I don't think I would try the fries again. But the sandwich, definitely.

Abby Tang: I was expecting to like it more. It's got all the fuss. People love Chick-fil-A. People are super excited about it. Like the one that just opened around the corner, there are lines still coming out the door, I think. But why?

What millennials can learn about finances from pokémon go,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-ruderman/what-millennials-can-lear_b_11059682.html,"So, if you're one of the millions of millennials swept up in the Poké craze, here's a starter set of personal finance tips, in the Pokémon Go language I know you will understand.

1. Level up in Pokémon. Level up in income.

The single most important thing you can do for your financial health is to make more money. With more income, you can save more. So, level up your negotiation skills, or find a new job if you're not being paid your market value. Sites like Glassdoor can give you insight into how much you should be paid at your level. Also, seek out opportunities with longer-term financial benefits like 401k matching and bonus potential.

2. Unlike in Pokémon Go, join multiple teams.

In Pokémon Go, you pick your team, and you pick it once. Maybe you're a better fit for Team Mystic (calm and smart), Team Valor (strong and hardworking), or Team Instinct (trusting your gut). But in the real world, you can combine more than one skill and join more than one team to bring in extra income. Are you a good writer? You can write for popular company blogs as a freelancer. Do you have a car and a few extra hours each weekend? Consider signing up for Uber or Lyft as a driver. Did you crush your SATs and get into a really good college? Think about being an admissions tutor.

3. Have too many Pokémon? Have too many subscriptions? Get rid of them!

Rumors are that Niantic, the maker of Pokémon Go, will add a new feature that lets users trade their Pokémon with friends. If you don't need them or use them, let them go. The same can be said for any monthly subscriptions that you don't need. Take a hard look at that Birchbox membership, Netflix account, or gym membership if it goes untouched. This is often an easy way to save money every month. Just make sure you save it and don't spend it.

4. The best things in the game, as in life, are free!

It's hard to succeed at Pokémon Go sitting on your couch. You have to go out into the world, walk or run from place to place, and experience your city. And you can earn points just for playing successfully. It's a good reminder that there are amazing, rewarding things in this world that don't cost money. Does your city or town do free movies in the park during the summer? When did you and your significant other last cook dinner together? Are you near an ocean, lake, or pond that you can swim in this summer or skate on this winter? You might even catch a rare Pokémon there.

5. That egg doesn't hatch by itself!

In Pokémon Go, you might have to walk 5 kilometers to hatch your 5k egg. In the real world, that nest egg requires work, as well. Take the extra mile to make sure you're actually contributing to your retirement savings. If your company offers a 401k, make sure you are siphoning off a chunk every paycheck that is directly deposited into your retirement account. If you don't work at a company with a 401k, you can still save into an IRA.",2016-07-20,what millennials can learn about finances from pokémon go,What Millennials Can Learn About Finances From Pokémon Go,"['Can', 'Learn']","['What', 'Finances', 'Pokémon']","['millennials', 'go']",1.0
Why are millennials avoiding credit cards?,http://www.wbrc.com/story/35937796/why-are-millennials-avoiding-credit-cards,"Credit card usage is dropping among the millennial generation. A surprising 67% of Americans between 18 and 29 years of age have no credit cards at all, according to a recent survey. That compares to only 45% of Americans between the ages of 30 and 49, and 38% of those aged 50-64 without credit cards. At 32%, even less Americans aged 65 and over are without a credit card.

The 2009 Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act probably played some part in the decrease by making credit cards difficult to obtain for those under age 21. Whopping levels of student debt also play a role, as millennials are wisely afraid to add more debt to their loan obligations.

Unemployment may be keeping some millennials from qualifying for credit, but others appear to be avoiding credit cards as a matter of principle.

Given America's soaring credit card debt, that is a positive development or is it? Consider some of the potential advantages of credit card use.

Credit.com suggests that the average person without credit cards could pay almost $160,000 in extra interest over a lifetime when compared to the interest rates acquired through responsible credit card use. While there are many assumptions involved in that figure, the principle is sound.

However, many millennials are putting more emphasis on the negative side of credit cards, such as these examples.

The most responsible path is to use cards sparingly, pay them off in full each month, and stay at a small fraction of your credit limit (10% or less if possible). This strategy will give you the best credit rating without increasing your debt.

Avoiding credit cards is advisable if you cannot use them responsibly. However, it is better to learn how to use cards sparingly and intelligently.

The same properties that can cause you to run up credit card debt (such as lack of self-control, poor budgeting and overspending) are going to cause problems in other areas of life eventually. Once you get those habits under control, you may not feel the need to avoid credit cards.",2017-07-30,why are millennials avoiding credit cards?,Why Are Millennials Avoiding Credit Cards?,['Are'],[],['cards'],0.0
Record number of millennials are living with their parents,http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/record-number-millennials-living-parents-article-1.2432155,"That last recession was the Millennial generation's Great Depression.

The number of young adults between the ages of 18 and 34 living with their parents has reached numbers not seen since the 1940s, according to Census data analyzed by the Pew Research Center.

A whopping 42.8% of Millennial men are mooching off mom and dad -- the largest share than at any point since 1940, when 47.5% remained home.

And young women are stuck in arrested development too, with with 36.4% crashing with their folks or relatives -- roughly the same numbers as 1940.

Experts believe the twenty- and thirtysomethings are hanging onto their parents' apron strings because they tend to delay marriage and get college educated.

""College students -- including those enrolled part-time and at community college -- are significantly more likely to live with family than young adults who are not in college,"" said Pew Center senior economist Richard Fry.

In 2014, 45% of young females in college lived with family, compared with 33% of young females not in college, and who had likely already entered the workforce.

Fry also revealed that Millennial women are half as likely to be married (just 30%) as their foremothers were in 1940 (62%), he or she is not ready to shack up with a significant other.

The survey reveals another household trend: The number of multi-generational households has continued to rise since the 1970s.

But it's also the economy, stupid. The Swinging Sixties was the most independent generation, with just a quarter of young people living at home. But the number of young adults lingering in the nest has risen steadily each decade through the new millennium before seeing a spike after the 2008 Great Recession.

Even as unemployment rates have started to drop, the Millennials' student loan debt and lingering fears about the economy still make them hesitant to strike out on their own.

""Wages have not seen a ton of growth, especially for young people, since the end of the Recession,"" Gillian White, a reporter from The Atlantic, told PBS Newswire. ""So if you still feel you might have a difficult time paying rent, paying utilities, paying for all of these differing things, it might feel safer to just go ahead and stay home.""",2015-11-12,record number of millennials are living with their parents,Record number of Millennials are living with their parents,"['are', 'living']","['Millennials', 'their parents']","['number', 'living']",0.0
"In state legislatures, millennials are often left out",http://www.theday.com/article/20151230/NWS13/151239967,"WASHINGTON -- State lawmakers across the U.S. are older than their constituents, an imbalance that might be tilting policymaking toward the interests of seniors and away from the country's largest living generation: millennials.

The average age of lawmakers in the 50 states is 56, putting a majority of them in the baby boom generation, which started coming of age politically in the 1960s and '70s, according to a new survey by Stateline and the National Conference of State Legislatures. It's higher in some states, such as New Hampshire, where the average age is 66, and Idaho, where it's 63. The average age of the U.S. voting population, meanwhile, is 47.

Millennials, those born after 1980 who entered adulthood at the turn of the century, hold just 5 percent of state legislative seats, while comprising 31 percent of the U.S. voting-age population. Millennials recently became the largest living generation.

Millennials in the early stages of their professional lives are less apt to run for office than older people who are more settled in their careers or are nearing retirement. The problem, some political scientists say, is that when younger legislators are left out, so are their viewpoints.

Older legislators -- who also tend to be wealthier -- may be less likely to focus on issues such as school spending and student loan debt. Too much gray hair in a legislative body also leaves some younger voters feeling disconnected from the political process.

The result may be a self-perpetuating cycle. Michael McDonald, an associate professor of political science at the University of Florida, said while there are few young faces in the legislatures, there are even fewer at the polls, where turnout among young voters is ""abysmally low."" Census data show 23 percent of millennials voted in the 2014 elections compared with 59 percent of those 65 and older.

""If state legislators don't perceive young people to be engaged, they're not going to be standard-bearers for the issues young people care about,"" he said.

A legislator's political outlook can be colored by his or her stage of life and by generational experiences. Millennials, for instance, are more likely to be single. They have higher levels of student loan debt, poverty and unemployment, and lower levels of wealth and personal income than their predecessor generations had at the same age.

Politically, they expect to get less from government programs such as Social Security. Those with young children are more interested in funding public education than older people whose children are grown, and who may be reluctant to pay higher taxes to support schools.

Millennials also are more racially diverse than older generations, and more socially liberal. Sixty-nine percent of millennials favor legalizing marijuana, for instance, while 52 percent of boomers do.

That diversity, however, may not show in the legislature. Ruth Mandel, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers, found there are far more young men serving as state legislators than women. The career and family concerns that keep young people from running for office tend to impact women more.

In Nebraska, where millennials make up 16 percent of the Legislature -- higher than in any other state -- younger lawmakers ""know what's going on with families,"" said Republican state Sen. Beau McCoy, a 35-year-old father of four. ""We have careers. We multitask. When you've been newly married, raising kids, have a small business -- we understand very well the things we have worked on.""

In New Hampshire, state Rep. Travis Bennett, a 23-year-old college senior at Plymouth State University, thought it important to speak out on behalf of his fellow students against a bill instituting a 30-day residency requirement to register to vote. He said the measure would have dampened the political participation of college students. Members of the New Hampshire General Court, the oldest state legislators in the country, approved the bill, but Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan vetoed it. Bennett, who is slated to graduate this year, said he doesn't plan to run again, in part because of the low pay -- in New Hampshire legislators earn $100 a year -- and the challenges of finding a flexible job that would allow him to be in the legislature.

Most issues that confront states cross generational boundaries. In Maine, for instance, many young people are leaving the state in search of greater economic opportunity elsewhere. It's an issue that affects older Mainers as well as millennials, said state Rep. Ryan Fecteau, a 23-year-old Democrat.

The departure of young residents shrinks the state's tax base, which creates a greater property tax burden on elderly homeowners. It also makes it harder for retirees to sell their homes. In response, Fecteau introduced a bill to help those with student loan debt get into their first home by reducing some of their debt, though it did not pass the Senate.

Don't beat millennials - join 'em!,http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1705/S00014/dont-beat-millennials-join-em.htm,"Millennials. Employers have denounced them as a generation who require constant affirmation in order to get hard work out of them.

But what if we have it all wrong? What if the secret to our techno-centric future is unequivocally tied up not so much in our acceptance of Generation Y - aka the Millennials - as our willingness to actually emulate them?

Picture a world without books: a dystopian future in which, under the guise of advancement, mankind has unknowingly traded imagination and creativity for technology.

If this picture frightens you, you probably aren't Generation Y - the largest living generation - who would embrace this future in much the same way that it has every curveball thrown at it. Never mind embrace it, their perception would be wholly antithetical: to a millennial a world sans books represents the very epitome of progress.

If we want to progress, to think beyond tomorrow - beyond disruption - we have to embrace this mindset. It's crucial to our future - and a must if we're to position ourselves for acceleration.

Who Millennials are - supposedly

Generation Y has been derided as a lazy, entitled lot, as evidenced by their many monikers, including Generación ni-ni (neither studying nor working) in Spain, Generation Maybe in Germany (so overwhelmed by opportunity they fail to commit to anything), ken lao zu in China (for their perceived lack of focus), and the Curling Generation in Sweden (a reference to the sport and in jest of a generation which supposedly has it easy).

What Millennials have achieved

According to the 2014 Duke University/CFO Magazine Global Business Outlook Survey, 21% of CFOs said Millennials are more creative and innovative than other workers - and they work for less. The same survey said that more than 70% of CFOs said that one advantage of hiring Millennials was the technology savviness they brought.

Their innovation can be seen across industries. Among Forbes' list of seven new companies started by Millennials is Snapchat, which provides a platform for users to share photos and chat through their smart devices. Then there's Synotrac, which has pioneered a sensor that detects early biomarkers for infection in the synovial fluid of the knee.

In 2015, Huffington Post published a list of eight startups which turned Millennials into millionaires, including makeup subscription company Ipsy, news summarisation app Summly - founded in 2011 by the then 16-year-old Nick D'Aloisio - and Theranos, a company which specialises in a painless way to draw and test blood and which launched its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, into billionaire status before the age of 30.

You can't beat 'em ...

It's not even about that. An outright dismissal of Millennials would constitute a grave mistake; we're effectively writing off our future in much the same way that every generation - from the Silent Generation (born before 1945), to the Baby Boomers and Generation X - has decried the generation succeeding it.

Stereotypes and preconceptions aside, the hard fact is that, by 2025, Millennials will constitute 75% of the workforce.

... It's time to join 'em

Just like technology has obliterated global communication barriers, we need to break conventional mindsets regarding how we do business.

To do so, we have to consciously engage a Millennial mindset. That entails the ability to think independently, challenge the status quo, push boundaries, create new paths, bring about social change and roll with the punches - all key Millennial traits.

These digital natives filter everything through the lens of technology. It might seem preposterous to older generations - but to Generation Y, technology and social networking isn't optional; it's how they operate and make sense of the world. They're seriously plugged in, not only riding the wave of technology with an almost innate ability, but also orchestrating the advancement of that technology - both through their creation of groundbreaking technologies and their demand for it.

This tech-savvy approach has also made them forecasters of future trends - they think beyond the here and now. As such, they're the key to our future. Not just that: we also need to think tech - to consume it almost as if by osmosis! It's the future calling.

The consequence of living through several world crises is a constantly changing socio-economic landscape; it has rendered Millennials a highly resourceful and entrepreneurial bunch. And it's this resourcefulness and entrepreneurial spirit that has to be woven into the genetic code of our companies to enable a culture of accelerated innovation.

A fast-paced news and communication environment means that we need to also be instantly responsive and adaptable, in the way that Millennials - who've grown up in this environment - instinctively are.

They've also deconstructed the very definition of work: being part of a global network means that the office walls have been eroded and work can take place anytime, anyplace. They want to redefine the work paradigm, taking it beyond work-life balance to work-life integration.

For business, that means being willing to rethink work environments and operations. We need to be open to a changing work environment, one in which a flat corporate structure is celebrated over a rigid hegemony; where employees are nurtured and social responsibility forms the very bedrock of our value system.

We also have to be as willing to learn from Millennials as we are to mentor them. An exchange of philosophies and skills which stems from a mutual respect for the other person will produce far better results than competing for sole recognition.

A Millennial movement

Ultimately, if technology is the axis on which the world of business spins, forget disruption. To remain cutting edge, we need to inculcate a spirit of entrepreneurship and a culture of innovation within our workplaces.

To do this we have to adapt our business environments for a Millennial movement - or risk those very businesses becoming white elephants.

And where would that leave us? Probably clutching our books, unwilling and unable to make sense of a world transformed by augmented reality.

"Stop calling us millennials, say millennials",http://www.theprovince.com/stop+calling+millennials+millennials/13646695/story.html,"By Olivia Rudgard

The word âmillennialâ has become synonymous with the young â"" but evidence suggests that they are starting to reject it.

According to research, three quarters of under-30s say they do not feel the term â"" for those born in the late Eighties and early Nineties â"" represents them and more than a third say they donât even know what it means.

The study, carried out by marketing agency ZAK, argues that those between 18 and 30 have been misunderstood by society. The research suggests that young people have had enough of the negative connotations of the word, and experts say they may have a point.

The paper is one of a series challenging the idea that young people are selfish and work-shy.

Elisabeth Kelan, professor of leadership at the Cranfield School of Management, who has researched millennials in the workplace, agreed that many of the stereotypes about young people have come out of their economic and social circumstances.

âMuch of the research is not based on really good evidence. I think itâs much more about the experiences that led you to have a specific mindset,â she said.

She added that she was ânot convincedâ that young people were less hard-working than their parents. They see it as a marathon not a sprint â"" itâs much more about where that job can take you in the future,â she said.

The term âmillennialâ came about because young people were unhappy at being called âGeneration Yâ â"" because it was too closely related to the previous group, Generation X, those born in the mid Sixties to early Eighties, added Professor Kelan.

Professor Cary Cooper, of Manchester business school, said young people were shaped by watching their parents divorce, lessening enthusiasm for romantic commitment, and seeing family be laid off during the financial crisis.",2017-07-10,"stop calling us millennials, say millennials","Stop calling us millennials, say millennials","['Stop', 'calling', 'say']","['us', 'millennials']","['say', 'millennials']",1.0
Column: millennials need to get to grips with basics,http://www.southyorkshiretimes.co.uk/news/column-millennials-need-to-get-to-grips-with-basics-1-8508819,"A survey has revealed that a shocking one in five people don't know how to boil an egg. A poll of over 2,000 adults revealed that many struggle with basic tasks, including how to change a light bulb.

A third admitted cooking a full meal without a recipe was beyond them, whilst half said they'd be clueless when it came to changing a nappy. The study, carried out by Aviva, revealed more than 60 per cent would be at a loss if they found themselves with a flat car tyre.

I sympathise with this, but that's why I've got roadside assistance. But how these non-egg boilers reached adulthood is beyond me. Even as a child I could do all these things because I was taught how to be self-sufficient.

I also knew how to wash, hang out, and iron my clothes. I also knew (thanks to my lovely dad) how to plant and grow vegetables from scratch, and what it felt like to enjoy the fruits of my labour when I later picked and ate them for dinner. But, it seems, today's millennials are missing out, because the skills we once had passed down from our mothers and fathers have been lost on the super technological young. Instead, four in every 10 adults under the age of 25, now turn to the Internet when they need help with DIY skills. Other everyday tasks people struggle with include bleeding radiators, with only 53 per cent agreeing they would be able to do so, checking a car's oil levels (also 53 per cent), to putting up a shelf (only a paltry 47 per cent). Now, I have to admit the only shelf I ever put up was a bit wonky and fell down when pressure was applied (i.e. books), but that's not the point. At least I attempted it.

Changing a plug also seemed like a doddle at the time, but when my portable TV continually flickered on and off, a friend suggested he'd take a look. He was stunned to discover I'd shoved all the excess wires into a huge bundle, hence my interrupted supply. It was, he declared, a complete death trap, and I was never trusted to change a plug again. But as most things come with plugs already attached these days, I realise it's not a necessity. I'm still not confident on all things motoring, but I'll have a bash.

I can, however, tile a whole kitchen and bathroom, and (thanks to my first flat) I know how to hang wallpaper, sand and varnish floorboards, do basic plumbing, and fit an old-fashioned fireplace from scratch.

Why millennials have the greatest stake in social security expansion - billmoyers,http://billmoyers.com/story/millennials-greatest-stake-social-security-expansion/,"No generation has a greater interest in the fight to protect and expand benefits.

Discussions about Social Security in politics and the media often focus on its role as a retirement program that provides vital protections to seniors. But the fact is that Social Security provides vital retirement, disability and survivors' insurance for all generations of Americans. In addition to significantly reducing senior poverty, Social Security is the nation's largest children's program, lifting 6.9 million Americans under age 65 out of poverty in 2014. And no generation has a greater stake in the fight to protect and expand Social Security benefits than today's young workers, the millennial generation.

After coming of age in the wake of the Great Recession, millennials have inherited decades of wage stagnation and growing inequality. While median annual wages have grown just $1,422 in real dollars from 1986 to 2013, the average cost of attending a four-year college has more than doubled. Unless these trends reverse, many millennials will have to defer saving for retirement in order to pay off their educational debts, leaving them with fewer resources in retirement beyond Social Security. Indeed, millennials have accumulated less wealth than their parents' generation had at the same age 25 years ago. These factors, combined with the disappearance of employer-sponsored traditional pension plans, mean that 3 in 5 younger households are at risk of being unable to maintain their standard of living in retirement.

The problem is particularly acute among millennials of color. Black and Latino households typically have lower incomes and significantly fewer assets than white, non-Hispanic households. And although Social Security benefits replace a larger percentage of lower earners' incomes, their benefits are still smaller than those received by higher earners -- leaving households of color less able to contend with the high health care costs experienced by seniors and people with disabilities.

Social Security is also critical to millennials during their working years. Before reaching their full retirement age, an estimated 1 in 4 of today's 20-year-olds will become disabled, and 1 in 8 will die. Such events can be devastating at any age, but they are especially harmful to young workers and their families, who will have had fewer years to pay off educational debts and accumulate wealth. Many of these young workers and their families -- especially those with low incomes -- are also unlikely to be covered by private insurance, particularly in the case of disability.

Fortunately, virtually all working Americans are covered by Social Security's disability and survivors' protections, and can expect to receive benefits for themselves and their families. These benefits are significant -- a 30-year-old worker who earns $30,000 a year with a spouse and two children has earned the equivalent of roughly $1.1 million in disability and life insurance protections through Social Security. Although no one anticipates dying young or experiencing a permanent disability, Social Security's modest but vital benefits are often the only way families can continue to afford basic necessities and avoid falling into poverty.

But instead of increasing benefits, opponents of Social Security suggest that spending on the old is stealing from the young, and that the nation must choose between supporting one generation or the other. They call for ""generational equity"" -- the idea that unless we cut benefits soon, we will run out of resources to protect younger workers in retirement. But this is false. Even after 2034, when the program's shortfall is projected to occur, Social Security will still be able to pay around 75 percent of promised benefits. And it's worth noting that the same individuals who call for changes to protect the young also promise to protect current beneficiaries by forcing benefit reductions entirely on new beneficiaries -- that is, by cutting the benefits of the same younger generations they claim to be protecting. These are unnecessary choices that other nations aren't making -- countries that spend more on seniors also spend more on children.

Social Security should be expanded now; not just for today's seniors, but for millennials as well. The program was created in response to economic circumstances similar to those that have shaped the formative years of today's young workers: the Great Depression. Social Security was a cornerstone of the New Deal, a range of policies which created jobs, invested in national infrastructure, regulated big banks and protected workers' rights. Similarly, expanding Social Security should be a cornerstone of an agenda for young workers, accompanying policies such as raising the minimum wage, closing the gender pay gap and adopting paid family leave. Not only would these policies improve the economic security of today's young workers; many of them would help to improve Social Security's long-range solvency as well.

Most importantly, millennials recognize that Social Security is a symbol of intergenerational solidarity, in which workers make contributions to fund current benefits while earning vital insurance protections for themselves and their families. Nearly 7 in 10 millennials agree that ""we should consider increasing Social Security benefits."" It's time for policymakers to listen to them, and expand Social Security for all generations of Americans.",2016-05-13,why millennials have the greatest stake in social security expansion - billmoyers,Why Millennials Have the Greatest Stake in Social Security Expansion - BillMoyers,['Have'],"['the Greatest Stake', 'Social Security Expansion']","['millennials', 'have']",1.0
A view of the horizon for millennials,http://www.royalgazette.com/robin-trimingham/article/20190129/view-of-horizon-for-millennials,"Millennials crave news updates, attention and validation perhaps more than any previous generation and yet they shun personal communication

Millennials are the paradox generation. Thanks to the advent of social media, they crave news updates, attention and validation perhaps more than any previous generation and yet they shun personal communication so vehemently that many of them would rather text a person across the room rather than engage in a verbal conversation.

Is this a problem?

On the surface there might appear to be some advantages to being able to text exactly what you think or feel without having to deal with the face-to-face consequences that your words create inside the person on the receiving end of your transmission -- especially if you then take the position that it is also acceptable to ""ghost"" someone who calls you out on your behaviour by ignoring, blocking or ""unfriending"" them.

If this is the cyber code of conduct that you practise in your personal life, are you setting yourself up for success in your professional life?

Call me old-school but I am from the generation that once looked forward to dressing up for work. Donning a suit and shiny shoes on a Monday morning, I instinctively knew that I was heading off to work in an environment where manners and professionalism ruled every business encounter be it by means of a letter, e-mail, phone call or personal interaction.

Today, however, the lines are much more blurred. Shuffling into the office in slacks and sneakers with unbrushed hair, my thumbs hammering at the smartphone jammed under my nose might seem comfortable, convenient and efficient, but is this a mode of behaviour in the workplace that actually makes me approachable, let alone promotes idea-sharing, positivity or a productive work environment?

If your answer is ""Sure, I don't need to deal with anyone to get my job done"", I wonder whether you have ever considered what sort of a future you are setting yourself up for by avoiding developing your personal communication skills. Better yet, have you ever considered what opportunities you might be missing out on now by continually sending the message ""leave me alone, I'm busy""?

If your answer is ""No, at work we have to put away our phones and find a way to meet face-to-face, make plans and decisions and help each other reach our common goals"", then why is it that we are still tempted to engage in emotionless cyber whiplashing in our personal lives?

Furthermore, if you are spending the majority of your time simply ""reacting"" to the barrage of incoming stimuli beaming towards you via your social-media accounts -- be it positive or negative -- has it occurred to you that you are, in essence, only experiencing ""connectivity without substance"" and running the risk of locking yourself into a passive state where you pass from one day to the next creating nothing, and wondering why life never seems to improve?

There is no doubt that it is possible to learn many skills independently online but deeper learning -- things like mind-expanding conceptualisation, wisdom and behavioural modification -- still happens best with face-to-face interaction.

The same is true of career and life planning. The leaders of tomorrow will be those who have spent time developing intangible human interaction skills such as patience, listening, empathy and public speaking. To even inquire what opportunities might be available to you requires engaging in a career development discussion with your employer in which you need to be able to express your areas of interest and career aspirations in a calm, concise manner and work with your boss to develop a career development plan.

And guess what?

To identify the career and life goals that you will outline in this conversation will require investigation and thought and planning and discussion with colleagues, near and far.

It may include asking questions such as: How did you get your current position? Do you like what you do? What would I need to study to qualify for a position like this? Who would I need to work shadow to learn more about this opportunity?

Then once you have done this research, figuring out how to present your findings in a thoughtful and compelling way to your employer to elicit assistance in formulating and confirming a career development plan.

While the internet age has brought much to our lives, the fact is that technology cannot replace quality human interaction in many life-changing situations -- to navigate these moments successfully, requires practising and refining our interpersonal skills as often as possible.",2019-01-29,a view of the horizon for millennials,A view of the horizon for millennials,[],"['the horizon', 'millennials']",['view'],0.0

Today, every person's life revolves around social networking sites be it Facebook, Instagram, YouTube as well as Twitter. These social networking sites provide entertainment through listicles, memes, brand integrations, interviews, articles and videos. RVCJ Media helps to achieve their goal of digital engagement. They provide an array of social media services like meme marketing, video marketing through listicles, DVC, TVC, article development and other social networking sites. The company claims that their modern and diligent solutions are not only effective, but also ensure that one climbs the ladder of success with a super fast speed.

Founded on 10th October, 2010 by Shahid Javed Ansari, Ankit Mor and Harpreet Singh, RVCJ Media offer an array of social media amplification services like meme and video marketing, article development, social media amplification and creative campaign development. Seven years back, Shahid Javed Ansari, founder of RVCJ Media, introduced an entertainment facebook ""Page"" feature. Initially, he used the page to share SMS jokes on the page and soon started rolling out memes, when he roped in with the Co-founder Ankit Mor to be its admin. Harpreet Singh later came in to the picture as the other co-founder, when he helped RVCJ to have its own viral entertainment website.

RVCJ which competes with the likes of ScoopWhoop, Filtercopy, Wittyfeed and Storypick among others, is a self funded platform, however, they are looking out for some investors now. RVCJ charge flat rates for amplifying a brand existing content like videos, Memes etc on their social media platforms. They have a rate card for different platforms and pricing is dynamic and purely depends on the appetite of the brand at that point of time.

It has 14 million followers on Facebook, 1.5 million followers on Instagram, 180,000 followers on Twitter and 185,000 followers on YouTube. RVCJ websites has 9 million monthly users and gets 42 million monthly page views on its website.

BW Disrupt interacts with RVCJ founders and spoke to them:

How has the traffic increased over the past few months?

The traffic has steadily been increasing as the FB algorithm has been more liberal with our FB page reach and the traffic has been better than what it was in January. The traffic also spikes when there is a season going like the IPL, World cup and so on. We also get a lot of redirected traffic from our Youtube and Instagram pages well. When people subscribe to our channel and watch our videos on youtube, they are bound to visit the website as well. So the unique visitors we get per month is always high because of our daily engagement with our subscribers, we make a post on our FB page every 10-15 mins daily! End of the day we are able to retain such huge numbers only because of the quality of our content and how this content has been able to sustain the interest among our followers.

What has been the main source of traffic? Share some of the links...

Our main source of traffic has been through our 14 million followers on our FB page. As and when we make new content on youtube and other platforms, then the inflow is increased and we end up acquiring a lot of new subscribers.

For example, the below 3 video on our Youtube page, have led to incremental website traffic:

Every Chindi Ever | Ft. Chote Miyan & Nikhil Vijay | RVCJ

Every Indian Shopper Ever | Ft. Bade & Nikhil Vijay | RVCJ

Indians During Sale ft. Chote Miyan & Abhinav

What are some of the key things that you are working to do in the coming months?

We are working on our youtube channel quite aggressively. We are constantly developing quality video content and the target is to release 1 video every 7 days. We have hired some of the top writers in the comic sketch industry in Mumbai who are whipping out content day after day to meet the demand of actually producing and releasing 5-6 videos per month. So that is something our fans and subscribers can expect from us.

We have also recently started a Tech page on FB called TECH INFORMER. The page immediately gained instant traction and amassed 40k followers on the FB page instantly. We are slowly going to start a Youtube channel and a Website for this platform as well in the coming months so the Tech community can look for some exciting engagement coming their way.

What is the traffic expectation?

Do you have some marquee brands working with RVCJ?

Our past few campaigns with Future Retail and Ivoomi (New Mobile Brand) have seen considerable traction. We also service a lot of new and young brands like Beardo, Xiaomi, Jio and many more. Also we work with all the leading studios and production houses month on month for various movie promotions in Bollywood and Hollywood industries.

What are your future plans?

This year, RVCJ plan to expand fully fledged sales and creative teams in Bangalore and Delhi as well. We are also planning to start mining into tier 2 brands and want to empower those who are craving digital media attention, through their expertise on social media platforms. The immediate goal for 2018 is to beat all our competitors in this space with excellent branding and PR which will have a waterfall effect on RVCJ by getting more business from brands in-turn.

Millennials don't recognize 'auschwitz' - this stat is scarier,http://newvoices.org/2018/05/01/worried-millennials-are-forgetting-the-holocaust-were-ignoring-the-scariest-statistic/,"According to a survey recently reported in the New York Times, 41 percent of millennials wrongly believe two million or fewer Jews died in the Holocaust and that 66 percent of millennials could not say what Auschwitz was.

But our community is missing the scariest data point from this survey. Another statistic from the study, one I've seen quoted less often than the two mentioned above, is far more concerning.

The survey also found that 52 percent of Americans wrongly believe that Hitler came to power through force.""

Of all the lessons which we have tried to carry with us in the last 70 years, among the most important is the way in which citizens of a country can be alienated, dehumanized, and stripped of their rights in a Western, democratic society.

The focus on the first two data points, about Auschwitz and the number of Jews killed, signals a deeply troubling particularist inclination in how we remember the Holocaust.

In my four years in college, multiple professors have stressed that classes are not about the memorization of specific dates or names but rather the ability to understand and articulate broader concepts.

This approach is how I reflect on the goals of Holocaust education and this specific survey. I am less concerned with whether or not my fellow millennials remember names or numbers, but rather if they understand the broader societal trends that made despotism, tyranny, and ultimately genocide possible.

Does millennials' inability to remember specific facts and figures about the Holocaust indicate their inability to understand and identify these broader concepts? Possibly.

But it's worth noting that the survey also found that 96 percent of respondents believe that the Holocaust happened and 80 percent believe it is important to keep teaching about the Holocaust so it does not happen again.

The issue is, if they don't know Hitler came to power in a democratic society, they don't know what it means to prevent it from happening again.

Jewish reactions to this survey data showed great desire for expanded Holocaust education, measured in how much others remember about the specific details of our suffering. While that knowledge has value, in my mind, the 'never again' and 'never forget' refrains are not only reminders of our suffering and vulnerability but also need to be a broader reminder of our responsibility to work against the suffering and vulnerability of others.

More generally, if our greatest collective concern as American Jews is about, as the TV show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend put so bluntly, whether or not our fellow Americans simply ""remember that we suffered,"" our community has a much deeper identity crisis.

The memory of the Holocaust is indelibly seared into the American Jewish consciousness, and it's hard to imagine a time when the Holocaust is not a part of our communal identity, but it cannot be the primary feature of that communal identity. I'm not suggesting that we forget about our past suffering but rather that we do not allow it to paralyze us and instead use its lessons to prevent future suffering.

As a descendant of both survivors and those murdered in Europe, the Holocaust is a permanent feature of my personal Jewish identity, but it makes up only a part of that identity. I don't want the tears I've shed for my murdered ancestors to be compounded by tears over our communal paralysis.

We can decry the inability of our fellow citizens to remember the specifics of our suffering in Europe, but we must also remember the universalist lessons of that suffering. We must resist the notion that the Holocaust should be a central component informing the way non-Jewish Americans look at us. We should instead use our history to help others remember broader lessons about how genocide can happen, even in societies like ours, and how we can fight against those forces today.

A lot of millennials want to work for goldman sachs,http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/goldman-sachs-receives-250000-job-applications-students-graduates-1563955,"US banking giant Goldman Sachs said it has received 250,000 job applications from graduates and students, despite the sector's relatively poor reputation. The bank said the number of worldwide applications from students and graduates has soared over 40% in the last four years, although it indicated the data can include more than one application per individual.

The figure, which show Goldman Sachs is attracting demand from way more people it could potentially employ, mirror those released by another heavyweight of the banking industry, JP Morgan.

The New York-listed lender said it is currently hiring only 2% of those who apply to join its investment banking division, while the figure rises to 2.7% at Citigroup.

According to a Financial Times report, the number of graduate applications at JP Morgan rose 40% compared to 2014, while Morgan Stanley's North American investment banking division was now attracting about 8,000 applications a year, up from compared with just over 6,000 a decade ago.

Together with the fact that a number of banks have reported higher retention rates and an increased number of applications the figures seems to dispel the myth that the banking industry is suffering from a ""brain drain"".

The sector's poor reputation and the increased expectations for employees to work very long hours appeared to have turned students and graduates away from the banking sector. However, the trend now appears to be reversed, although the higher number of applications can also be partly explained by the declining number of investment banks in the field compared with the years before the financial crisis.

""They are trying to replicate the Google model,"" Bernie Toole, who heads the investment banking unit at recruitment group Selby Jennings, was quoted as saying. ""Before they used to churn analysts, now they are trying to attract and retain them by introducing a more positive culture, with perks and more flexible working practises.""",2016-06-06,a lot of millennials want to work for goldman sachs,A lot of millennials want to work for Goldman Sachs,"['want', 'work']","['millennials', 'Goldman Sachs']","['lot', 'want']",0.0
"Millennials aren't big spenders or risk takers, and that's going to reshape the economy",http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/business/article108701157.html,"WASHINGTON - They're known for bouncing around jobs, delaying marriage and holing up in their parents' basements.

Dubbed recently as the ""children of the Great Recession"" by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, millennials are the best educated and most diverse population of young people in U.S. history. They are also perhaps the most coddled, some would say spoiled.

As they emerge this year as the United States' largest demographic group - some 75 million strong - millennials are taking up the mantle as the most impactful generation since the baby boomers.

Their influence has started slowly, due largely to the economic instability that has left many struggling to find good-paying jobs and saddled with staggering student loan debt.

But millennials - adults under 35 - are certain to shape the economy for decades to come. And their coming of age in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression has bred distinct traits that could pose special challenges for the nation's future growth and prosperity.

For starters, millennials are not big spenders, at least not in the traditional sense.

Millennials tend to prefer experiences over buying things and accumulating stuff. To them, an impressive selfie capturing a memorable moment is, in some sense, as enviable as a new car or fancy watch was to their parents.

Neil Howe, an economist and demographer who coined the term ""millennials"" with co-author William Strauss, sees it as part of a redefining of American conspicuous consumption.

Instead of material wealth, millennials show off through their travels, hobbies and even meals, which get photographed and posted on Facebook, Instagram and other social media.

""If you're a foodie, you can go out and have some incredible dining experience, and then you can curate it almost as if it were a thing,"" Howe said. Millennials are one reason restaurants have been doing well - and hiring so many workers.

Dominick Ardis, 29, typifies his generation. In between jobs this year, the Tallahassee, Fla., resident scrounged money from family and friends so he could immerse himself in Hebrew studies this summer at Middlebury College in Vermont. Last year it was the art of glass-blowing. And before that he was getting voice lessons.

""Music is such an emotional and experiential event,"" he said. Ardis is interested in his career and making money, too. It's just that he's got other things on his mind, like taking a trip to Cuba next year.

Such priorities may well give Ardis and his fellow millennials a more fulfilling, well-balanced life than, say, workaholic boomers. But that may not be great for a U.S. economy driven by consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product.

Young Americans are unusually optimistic, which could propel purchases - and economic growth - as their disposable income increases. But they're still not likely to have as much left over because so much is going for skyrocketing rents and education expenses.

The low home-buying rate of young adults already has been a big factor in the slow housing market. The homeownership rate for those under 35 slipped to a low of 34 percent this year, compared with around 40 percent for young adults in the prior three decades. And people today are getting married and having children later, which will weigh on home sales in the future.

""I don't believe they're going to catch up,"" said John Burns, an Irvine, Calif.-based national real estate consultant.

Like other millennials, Summer Lollie is keenly interested in having her own place. She wants something close to her parents' two-story, four-bedroom house in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite where she grew up and currently lives, she says. But the 27-year-old community organizer can't imagine how she will be able to save up for a down payment and afford a mortgage.

While Lollie's parents never finished college, she graduated from Washington and Lee University, a well-regarded school in Lexington, Va. But with more than $35,000 in student debt and a car loan to boot, she has struggled to make ends meet. She moved back with Mom and Dad in April 2015, paying a little rent to them.

There's more than economics behind the living-at-home phenomenon, however. Lollie doesn't mind the arrangement at all because she likes being with her parents - something more common among millennials than people of their age in previous generations. Experts think that reflects their protective upbringing and more-frequent exchanges, thanks in part to the rise of texting and social media.

""I have loving parents here,"" Lollie said.

Another key difference with their predecessors, particularly Generation X, is that millennials are not big risk takers. That seems especially true when it comes to starting businesses.

The rate of new startups is higher today than 10 or 20 years ago for every major age group - except those between 20 and 34 years old, according to the Kauffman Foundation's latest annual study of entrepreneurship.

The result is that the composition of new business formation, already turning grayer with the aging of baby boomers, has shifted even more sharply to older adults in recent years.

Two decades ago, a little more than 34 percent of all new entrepreneurs in the U.S. were younger than 34 years old. Today it's just 25 percent.

""This could be really troubling,"" says Arnobio Moreli, a senior research analyst at Kauffman.

Startups represent dynamism in the economy. New and young businesses have long created the bulk of new jobs in America, and are critical for productivity growth, too.

Moreli believes some would-be entrepreneurs are being held back by their heavy student debt load. Nonetheless, he finds it puzzling that there seems to be relatively less entrepreneurial zeal among millennials, particularly since they grew up in an era when people like Facebook founder and millennial Mark Zuckerberg, 32, have been celebrated in business schools and popular culture.

In fact, however, there's evidence that young adults today would rather work for big companies than take their chances at budding firms or in their own garages. Compared to boomers, millennials are more interested in having the same job through most of their life, says Jean Twenge, a San Diego State University psychologist and author of ""Generation Me.""

Their relative risk-aversion may have something to do with the protective environment that parents and schools created for millennials, emphasizing participation over winning. Said Twenge: ""Everybody got a trophy.""

Partly because of such pampering, Twenge argues, millennials are more self-absorbed than prior generations, even narcissistic. But at the same time, research suggests that young adults today are also very community-minded.

If baby boomers were known as the ""me"" generation, millennials might be called the ""we"" generation.

Surveys have found that millennials, while less interested in traditional politics, care deeply about their communities and are volunteering more than earlier generations of young people.

""I do sense that public service, community service is in their DNA,"" said John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. He thinks that's partly because many high schools, starting in the 1990s, mandated community service hours before graduation.

Millennials also came of age in a more racially diverse and economically stratified America, which has made them more sensitive to social issues and things like gender and income inequality. Gay rights are a given.

Back in 1990, whites made up 73 percent of young adults age 18 to 34. That share dropped to 63 percent in 2000, when millennials were just entering adulthood, and it's now down to 55.8 percent, according to William Frey, a Brookings Institution demographer.

Increasingly, the face of prime-age workers in the U.S. are people like Lionel Mares of the Sun Valley neighborhood of Los Angeles.

A second-generation Mexican American who grew up watching news of school shootings and inner-city violence, the 30-year-old pursued a degree in sociology from Cal State Northridge. Mares, too, has struggled to find a good job, and in recent months has been volunteering at a local legal aid center.

His heroes aren't Zuckerberg or athletes like Michael Phelps. He gets inspiration from people like Eleanor Roosevelt, the first lady known for her social reform work and spirit of volunteerism.

Mares is the first in his family to graduate from college; his dad was a handyman, his mom a seamstress. He plans a career in the public sector. ""I want to give back to the community,"" Mares said.

Their emphasis on community and social causes is starting to be felt on Wall Street, too. Beyond their outsized participation in the Occupy Wall Street movement a couple of years ago, millennials already are overrepresented in investments focusing on so-called environmental, social and governance issues, said Amy O'Brien, managing director and head of responsible investment at TIAA Global Asset Management.

She notes that many millennials were in high school and college when the financial crisis struck, and that's had a lasting influence. ""They put a large value on business ethics,"" O'Brien said.

Their sense of community has also made millennials more progressive when it comes to public assistance programs, from Obamacare to student debt relief. And far from the antigovernment spending mantra espoused by many of their parents, millennials have largely embraced liberal ideals about government, explaining why Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton (and her former rival Sen. Bernie Sanders) have put forward programs to subsidize college tuition and raise the federal minimum wage.

""They actually trust big institutions like government more than older people (do),"" said Howe, the generational trends expert. ""They believe we could put in a strong set of community and national organizations that would assume a high degree of dependence on these institutions .... We would all give more to the community and the community would give us back in an equitable way.""",2016-10-17,"millennials aren't big spenders or risk takers, and that's going to reshape the economy","Millennials aren't big spenders or risk takers, and that's going to reshape the economy","['are', ""'s"", 'going', 'reshape']",['the economy'],"['millennials', 'are', 'that']",1.0
"While the rest of the industry struggles, this store has created the 'best business model in apparel'  --  and millennials are flocking to it",http://www.businessinsider.com/why-zara-is-crushing-the-retail-industry-2016-5,"But one company has managed to buck all of the ugly trends in the market.

That's Zara - which is beloved by young, fashion-forward women.

It's almost like it built itself to operate successfully among today's millennial and teen shoppers that are frugal, value-minded, and demanding quick, speedy, on-trend fashion.

The company does so well because it has a phenomenal operating supply chain and manages its inventory well, creating great value for customers and shareholders alike.

It helps set it apart from other fast-fashion retailers like H&M, Forever 21, and the frighteningly cheap Primark.

""If I had to condense the foundations for Zara's success, I would say it comes down to agility and flexibility,"" Neil Saunders, CEO of retail consulting firm Conlumino, said in an e-mail to Business Insider in December. ""From these things flow a number of advantages: quickly picking up on new fashion trends, accurate forecasting of stock requirements which reduces markdowns, quick turn of stock which keeps customers coming back for new product, good responsiveness to external factors like the weather, and margin maximization.""

A report Suzy Hansen in The New York Times Magazine revealed how Zara doesn't stock a lot of clothes, and the company updates what's in stores regularly. That benefits the company in two ways: one, it doesn't have to resort to excess sales to rid itself of inventory, and two, it encourages consumers to shop with a sense of urgency - something that consumers don't have when it comes to shopping at a Banana Republic or J. Crew, when they have been conditioned to buy everything on sale.

It's incredibly swift at adapting, too, since it operates on a fast-fashion basis. This make Zara immune to sudden changes, like unseasonable weather or a sharp detour in fashion trends.

""This is a significant point of difference to most other apparel retailers which usually commit in advance of each season and have no capability to change volume or introduce new styles mid-season,"" Saunders wrote. ""Zara has always been this way, but in today's market where trends change rapidly and where the weather seems to fluctuate more, this has become a major source of competitive advantage.""

Zara also seems well suited for today's Instagram and Snapchat-obsessed era; today, consumers have a front seat to the runway and want the styles they see immediately, and at a sweet price point, too. Zara is able to do that thanks to its team that sources style rapidly; this helps hose who operate on that basis.

""Unlike fast-fashion retailers, which have buying teams sourcing current trending fashion from third-party vendors, traditional specialty retailers have design teams creating product they believe is going to be trending 12 months out,"" Goldman Sachs researchers wrote.

Its spurred change in the fashion industry - which is a unique observation, considering how Zara sources trend from the runway.

""They broke up a century-old biannual cycle of fashion,"" an analyst told Hansen. ""Now, pretty much half of the high-end fashion companies"" - Prada and Louis Vuitton, for example - ""make four to six collections instead of two each year. That's absolutely because of Zara.""

Zara also has an internal data center that helps it track but customers want and don't want, which is a huge boon to help it outlast others in the current retail environment.

This business model has proven to be so successful, that Zara's parent company, Inditex, has seen continual spikes in profits.

""We believe that Inditex has the best business model in apparel and expect Inditex to deliver double-digit earnings growth per year over the next five years,"" Bernstein analysts told The Wall Street Journal.

The ingenuity of Inditex stems from its founder, Amancio Ortega, who is currently the second-richest man in the world with a net worth of $69.2 billion, according to Wealth-X. That makes him even wealthier than Warren Buffett.

Ortega's wealth has led him to lead a life characterized by an air of mystery. He's extraordinarily private - Reuters notes that he very infrequently gives interviews - and despite his massive wealth lives frugally, wearing the same simple outfit each day (blue blazer, white shirt, and gray pants) and eating lunch with employees in the Zara headquarters cafeteria.

He's come a long way, though. According to Reuters, he grew up as the son of a man who worked in the railway industry, and at fourteen, he was a delivery boy. His biographer wrote that he sometimes couldn't afford food when he was growing up, and that he dropped out of school when he was a teenager.",2016-06-16,"while the rest of the industry struggles, this store has created the 'best business model in apparel'  --  and millennials are flocking to it","While the rest of the industry struggles, this store has created the 'best business model in apparel'  --  and millennials are flocking to it","['struggles', 'has', 'created', 'are', 'flocking']","[""the 'best business model"", 'apparel', 'it']","['rest', 'store', 'created', 'millennials']",1.0

Millennials listen up. As much as your colleagues are terrified of the supposed workplace apocalypse your generation brings, plenty of companies are overly eager for your talents. They desperately need your help decoding your fellow Gen Y workers. Some are willing to pay upwards of $20,000 an hour for it.

Wall Street Journal recently dug into a newly burgeoning industry: millennial consulting. Companies like Oracle, Red Robin Burgers and LinkedIn bring in these intergenerational consultants to help them better understand how to keep young people engaged at work.

Some of the them have millennial children themselves.

So what advice or business leadership direction do these millennial experts offer? They help their clients better understand what this generation values and is motivated by. The end goal is to bridge gaps between their multi-general workforces and increase employee engagement on the job.

So it's less about which in-office games to buy or which flavors of LaCroix to stock your shelves with. It's more about retaining talent by making changes that appeal to Millennials.

"Why aren't millennials spending? they're poorer than previous generations, fed says",https://www.keranews.org/post/why-arent-millennials-spending-theyre-poorer-previous-generations-fed-says,"Since millennials first started entering the workforce, their spending habits have been blamed for killing off industries ranging from casual restaurant dining to starter houses. However, a new study by the Federal Reserve suggests it might be less about how they are spending their money and more about not having any to spend.

A study published this month by Christopher Kurz, Geng Li, and Daniel J. Vine found millennials are less well off financially than members of earlier generations when they were the same ages, with ""lower earnings, fewer assets and less wealth.""

Their finances were compared to Generation X, baby boomers, the silent generation and the greatest generation.

The researchers examined spending, income, debt, net worth and demographic factors among the generations to determine ""it primarily is the differences in average age and then differences in average income that explain a large and important portion of the consumption wedge between millennials and other cohorts.""

Millennials, which the study defined as those born between 1981 and 1997, with ages ranging from 21 to 37, ""paid a price"" for coming of age during the Great Recession. They had to face historically weak labor demand and unusually tight credit conditions.

Dealing with those financial obstacles probably created ""attitudes toward saving and spending"" that might be ""more permanent for millennials than for members of generations that were more established in their careers and lives at that time,"" the study says.

Despite millennials' much-maligned, unofficial hipster status, the study indicates they're pretty mainstream.

Their spending on motor vehicles -- which is sensitive to economic expansion and contraction, and accounts for about 20 percent of retail sales -- shows millennial households have similar tastes and preferences to older generations, as does their spending on food and housing.

Their consumption habits are similar to their parents' and grandparents' -- millennials just have less money to spend.

The researchers also examined debt between each generation. While the comparisons were ""somewhat mixed,"" researchers said it ""seems fair"" to conclude that millennials have levels of debt about the same as Generation X, and more debt than baby boomers.

The study also noted newer financial obstacles for millennials. Broad economic trends depict a rise in health care expenditures, as well as a rise in college tuition that has outpaced general inflation that previous generations avoided in their young adulthood.

And the generation's higher rates of racial diversity, higher educational attainment and lower rates of marriage? Those are all consistent ""with secular trends in the population and are therefore not the aberrations of a single generation,"" the study said.

Millennials are still fairly young, so ""it remains to be seen whether having reached adulthood during those unfavorable years will have permanent effects on their tastes and preferences,"" the study says.",2018-11-30,"why aren't millennials spending? they're poorer than previous generations, fed says","Why Aren't Millennials Spending?

Is the resilience of millennials underrated?,http://iowapublicradio.org/post/resilience-millennials-underrated,"I'm a member of Generation Y, or the millennial generation. People like me were born in the '80s and early '90s. But I don't like to broadcast that fact. Millennials tend to get a bad rap.

Journalists and commentators love ragging on us. They say we're ill-prepared to deal with life's challenges. And that, as a result, we have higher rates of mental health issues like depression and anxiety.

These ideas have been coming up over and over again for almost a decade now. There's psychologist Jean Twenge, for instance, who in 2006 published a book called Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled -- and More Miserable Than Ever Before. ""In past generations, suicide and depression were considered afflictions of middle age,"" she writes. ""But for Generation Me, these problems are a rite of passage through adolescence and young adulthood""

Then there's the Slate article from a couple of years ago, titled ""Why Millennials Can't Grow Up."" The explanation, according to psychotherapist Brooke Donatone: ""Their biggest challenge is conflict negotiation and they often are unable to think for themselves."" Last year, in Vanity Fair, Bret Easton Ellis called us ""Generation Wuss."" Even NPR has asked: Are millennials too narcissistic? Do they stand a chance?

And now we're starting to turn against ourselves. In a recent Telegraph article reporter Rachael Dove, a self-identifying millennial, wrote a piece titled ""Anxiety: the epidemic sweeping through Generation Y.""

My friend Jay and I recently had a good laugh as we read through these articles together. ""Harsh,"" he said. ""But also kind of ridiculous.""

Still, I wondered: Could it be true? Could it be that millennials really are more depressed and anxious than young people from generations past?

""I've definitely heard reports regarding increased levels of psychopathology among millennials,"" says Mitch Prinstein, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""But I'm not sure there are data to support that.""

It's true that young adulthood can be a turbulent time -- for folks from any generation, Prinstein says. So young people are more likely than older adults to say they experienced a depressive episode in the past year.

But we can't really compare how depressed millennials are with how it was for our parents and grandparents when they were young.That's because researchers weren't very good at collecting data on on mental illness back in the '60s and '70s, when the baby boomers were in their late teens and 20s. The federal government does have data going back to the early 2000s, and depression rates haven't increased since then.

There are better stats on suicide among young people. Suicide rates for young adults increased through the '70s and '80s, but started dropping off in the late '90s and have continued to decrease. So, it seems young people these days don't have higher rates of suicide than generations past.

So where does this idea that millennials' mental health is declining even come from? Prinstein thinks people get that impression because we milliennials are full of angst. That's not new. But unlike past generations, we like to broadcast our angst.

""Millennials are certainly using social media in a way that we haven't seen with other generations,"" Prinstein says. ""They're not as shy about sharing their anxieties online.""

And we do have a lot of things to stress about, he says, like an uncertain employment future and student loans. But stress doesn't necessarily equate to depression.

""Depression is a biologically and psychologically driven form of mental illness that is remarkably common,"" Prinstein notes, ""but that is not necessarily experienced by everybody who is experiencing distress.""

Still, some, like Joseph Allen, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, are concerned. Allen, who specializes in adolescent psychology, says in many cases, parents have worked too hard to make it too easy for their millennial children.

Parents haven't challenged millennials to support themselves, he says, and millennials may find it difficult adjusting to adulthood. ""If you're living in the basement and playing video games because you can't get a job or you haven't been pushed to get a job, that's going to leave you feeling aimless and a bit at sea whether or not it counts as clinical depression in a formal way,"" Allen says.

But again, at this point there isn't any conclusive research to prove that millennials feel especially listless or unfulfilled.

In any case, Gen Y is doing some things right when it comes to mental health, Prinstein says. Young people are generally more comfortable discussing mental health these days, he notes. And that helps reduce stigma so more people who really need mental health care are getting it.

""So I'm not sure if it's fair to characterize millennials as a group as poorly prepared to deal with life,"" Prinstein says. ""They're differently prepared.""",2015-10-12,is the resilience of millennials underrated?,Is The Resilience Of Millennials Underrated?,['Is'],['Millennials'],"['is', 'resilience']",0.0
Colorado company wants to build campus for millennials in downtown joliet,http://www.theherald-news.com/2017/07/03/colorado-company-wants-to-build-campus-for-millennials-in-downtown-joliet/a7g3p70/,"JOLIET - A Colorado company is proposing a downtown campus providing incubator space, housing, a STEM school and even a playing field for Millennial-generation entrepreneurs.

Joliet is considering a yet to be disclosed incentive package for the project that would go to the City Council for a vote on July 18.

The campus would vary in size between 2.7 acres and 4.6 acres depending on whether it was located on the riverfront or on city owned property near the new transportation center under construction, according to preliminary plans from Innovation Pavilion.

Plans include several buildings totalling between 116,000 square feet and 201,000 square feet.

The Joliet campus would be one of the first, if not the first, such campus for the Centennial, Colorado-based company that was formed five years ago.

The project is just being unveiled publicly, although city officials have been meeting with representatives from Innovation Pavilion for months.

The basic idea is to create incubator space where young entrepreneurs would develop business ideas on a campus where they would also live and in an environment where they could socialize without the need for automobiles, Philip Hsiao, director of corporate innovation management at Innovation Pavilion, said.

""The Millennial wants to be able to work and engage with the community in a walkable and bikable environment,"" said Hsiao, calling Joliet ""the perfect location"" because of its proximity to Chicago. ""We want the campus to have access to the metropolitan area, but it will be a stand-alone ecosystem.""

One plan calls for an 11-story residential building overlooking the Des Plaines River. The other proposes four buildings at least three-stories high with 75,000-square-feet of ""Millennial housing. A 65,000-square-foot STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) school would be located nearby.

Innovation Pavilion is looking for Joliet to invest $200,000 in development money with the idea that a campus would be fully built out in two to three years, Hsiao said.

""We want the city to be committed,"" Hsiao said. ""They have to be very serious. It's a very long-term process.""

Joliet officials, including Mayor Bob O'Dekirk, visited the company's Centennial offices in September. and were impressed with the prospects of the campus plan, said Joliet Economic Development Director Steve Jones.

""It's got outrageous potential for multi-use development,"" Jones said.

Jones would not discuss what incentives Joliet is considering for the package. He said the city plans to make the incentive package public for the first time at a July 13 meeting of the city council's Economic Development Committee. The committee's chairman, Councilman Larry Hug, was among those who made the trip to Colorado.

Innovation Pavilion would make a presentation to the city council at its July 17 meeting, and the council would vote at its regular meeting the next day.

Hsiao said Innovation Pavilion wants to develop its concept in ""ring cities"" near major metropolitan areas. The company also has proposals pending in Olathe, Kansas outside Kansas City and Parker, Colorado in the Denver area.

Innovation Pavilion now operates out of one 80,000-square-foot building in Centennial, which provides incubator space for 75 companies, Hsiao said.",2017-07-05,colorado company wants to build campus for millennials in downtown joliet,Colorado company wants to build campus for Millennials in downtown Joliet,"['wants', 'build']","['campus', 'Millennials', 'downtown Joliet']","['company', 'wants']",0.0

There is nothing new about comments on how ""kids these days"" are different from the generations that came before them. In the case of Millennials, the U.S. Census Bureau has some data to back those observations up.

""Today's young adults look different from prior generations in almost every regard: how much education they have, their work experiences, when they start a family, and even who they live with while growing up,"" says a report from the Census Bureau released Wednesday.

The report looks at changes in social, economic and demographic trends among young American adults, defined as ages 18 to 34, over the past 40 years.

It found they increasingly live at home and delay starting a family. According to the report, that trend reflects a wider shift in attitudes about the importance of work and education over family. For example, more than half of all Americans think marriage and children are not important steps in becoming an adult, while ""more than 9 in 10 Americans believe that finishing school and being gainfully employed are important milestones of adulthood.""

The report's author, Jonathan Vespa, a demographer at the Census Bureau, looked at four ""common milestones of adulthood:"" Getting married, having kids, getting a job and living on your own. He found the percentage of Americans achieving all four of those milestones by age 34 dropped from 45% in 1975 to 24% in 2016.

Vespa also found that while living on your own and holding a job was the fourth most common scenario in 1975, being a ""single worker"" was the second most common scenario by 2016 (a rise from 6% to 23%).

The report also found young women are pulling ahead in employment and wages, while those numbers on are the decline for young men.

Here are some of the report's highlights:

In 1975, 25% of men between 25 and 34 had incomes of less than $30,000 (adjusted for inflation) per year. By 2016, it was 41%. The number of young women ages 25 to 34 in the workforce jumped more than 40% between 1975 and 2016. Those young women saw their median income rise from $23,000 to $29,000 in the same time period, although it remains $11,000 lower than young men. Between 1975 and 2016, the number of young female ""homemakers"" dropped from 43% to 14%. 1 in 3 young Americans lives with a parent or parents. Of those, 1 in 4 does not work or go to school. In 1975, far more young adults lived with a spouse than a parent. By 2016, more young adults lived with their parents than a husband or wife. 41% of young families had a student debt in 2013, up from 17% in 1989 and the amount owed on those loans has almost tripled. Young adults are increasingly putting off children and marriage. Vespa cautioned against drawing broad assumptions about young Americans based on this data. For example, living with their parents may now be the most common living arrangement among young adults, ""but we want to be careful and not say that one experience describes all of the young adults who are living in their parents' home.""

Many assume those young Americans are in the basement playing video games, but most of the more than 8.3 million young people living with their parents are either working or in school. Roughly 25% of those young people are not employed or going to school, but out of that group 28% have a disability and another 21% have a child.

It is also important to note these trends fluctuate among different demographic groups. For example, 37% of black Americans between ages 18 and 34 live at home, compared with 26% of young Asians and 21% of young black Americans live with a spouse or unmarried partner, compared with 44% of whites.

There are also dramatic differences depending on where young Americans live. In many Midwestern states, the increase in young adults living at home has grown far more gradually than in other regions. North Dakota actually had 3.5% fewer young adults living with their parents in 2015 than 2005. Florida, on the other hand, saw that group grow 11% in the same time period.

As the report concludes: ""If one theme describes how adulthood has changed over the last 40 years, it is growing complexity.""

The best definition of a father to millennials -,http://goodmenproject.com/families/definition-of-a-father-millennials-kldg/,"Millennials. You heard about us, right? I am sure that you have probably seen or heard of the term used in articles, on radio or TV. If you were born between 1980 and 1995, then guess what? You are part of the club!

We are the biggest generation in the workforce right now.

There is a good chance that you may be either a millennial or have a millennial kid.

Millennials are facing tough times. There are too many challenges to address in one article, but there are a few that are the most burdensome and worth mentioning here.

-30% of Millennials are still living with their parents

These statistics can feel more stressful to millennials, especially when they do not have a good set of parents to rely on for comfort.

There is no millennial that is without a father. One could define a father in its most basic form as a man who is biologically responsible for a pregnant woman.

Although, we are all too familiar with that definition. Many deadbeat fathers live up to that basic definition easily.

While the definition of a good father does not change much between generations, it does differ in some ways for millennials.

1. A father who understands that telling me to graduate from college to get a secure job is no longer good advice. I understand that it was good advice for the Generation X and Baby Boomer generation, but the times have changed.

Robert Kiyosaki (the international bestselling author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad and a multi-millionaire entrepreneur from the Baby Boomer generation) explained in our interview about how that advice is useless.

2. A father who understands that sending me off to college is not necessarily going to set me up for success. 60% of Americans are not paying back our student loans, which is hard to do when you are unemployed or underemployed.

3. A father who understands that becoming an entrepreneur is not a bad alternative, especially when 40% of the unemployed population are millennials.

4. A father who understands that spending some time abroad or in solitude can actually be beneficial to my overall success.

5. A father who understands that he may not like my friends or inspirations, but he understands that they are learning experiences to extract wisdom for the future.

6. A father who understands that I am not against voting. We do vote! We just do not vote for politicians!!

7. A father who understands that he does not have the right to conform me to his beliefs about religion, politics, sexual orientation, or anything else. His generation may have encouraged his beliefs, but it does not mean that he should not question them.

Our generation is a more socially accepting society. I do not support ideas that divide us, but I support ideas that unite us. It is unity, which influences us to employ thoughts that will create better relationships.

As a millennial, this is how I would define a great father. Do you agree? If you are a millennial or a father of a millennial, I would be happy to read your comments.",2016-06-21,the best definition of a father to millennials -,The Best Definition of a Father to Millennials -,[],['a Father'],['definition'],0.0
An open (financial) letter to millennials,https://medium.com/@Amitch5903/an-open-financial-letter-to-millennials-d52f25fbff1d#.56frmp7eq,"The millennial generation, generally classified as those born between 1980 and 1999, is transforming the economic, social, and political world of the United States.

Individuals in this generation are generally more optimistic, more diverse, and much more expressive (think Social Media) than older generations (US Chamber Foundation).

More from Alex Mitchell:

Building digital products: A handbook for product managers

10 bold predictions for the next 10 Years

The death of thinking

As an individual born right in the middle of this generation, I agree with the findings of this research. However, I want to focus on the many interesting financial characteristics and behaviors of my generation that may have the biggest impact of all these changes on our future.

Financial ""wins"" of the millennial generation

What do millennials do better?

1. Millennials value education

More millennials have a college degree than any other generation of young adults. In 2013, 47% of 25-34 year-olds received a post-secondary degree.

College graduates are able to earn an additional $1 million during their working lives compared to High School graduates. Millennials are investing in their future in this way, which is great news. But are they paying too much? We'll get to that later (White House Millennials Report).

2. Millennials don't buy cars (or even bother getting driver's licenses)

Millennials are about 29% less likely than those in Gen X to purchase a car (USA Streetsblog).

Diving a little deeper, in the chart below, you can see that in 2015, the share of car originations in the 22-35 age bracket was approximately 25% lower than it was during 2003, when the prior generation (Gen X) was in that same age bracket.

This is great news for millennials. While they're missing out on building their credit score through a car loan, they're avoiding taking on (even) more debt. The reason for lower car ownership shouldn't be surprising. The rise of Uber, Lyft, Car2Go, ZipCar, and many other transportation sharing options has made living without a car (in a city at least) possible for the first time.

3. Millennials live at home with their parents

For the first time since 1880, young adults aged 18-34 are more likely to live with a parent than in any other arrangement.

Even more surprisingly, this trend isn't being driven by the lack of employment, but rather the high cost of rent, delayed marriage, and a large increase in the high school education only segment of the generation (Pew Research).

For a generation that has the second-highest debt burden, this is good financial news. The millennial generation members who live at home could theoretically save more of their paycheck and pay down debt faster, right?

Not so fast. It's time for the financial fails of this new generation.

Financial ""fails"" of the millennial generation

What don't Millennials do right?

1. Millennials have little to no savings

23% of younger millennials (18-24) don't have a savings account.

Even of older millennials, the percentage isn't much better at 18%. What's interesting is this trend doesn't appear to be driven by income. For those millennials who make $75-$100k a year, 43% either don't have a savings account or have nothing saved (Millennial Money).

For anyone who's taken a basic math or finance class that covered the principle of compounding interest, you know this lack of savings won't end well for the millennial generation.

Take this simple example as proof:

Susan saves $5k/year from age 25-35 (10 years) Bill saves $5k/year from age 35-65 (30 years) John saves $5k/year from age 25-65 (40 years)

Who saves the most by retirement? Well, that should be pretty easy, it's John.

But by how much?

He will have saved over two times as much as Bill and close to two times as much as Susan by age 65.

Even more remarkable is that Susan, who only saved for 10 years, will have out-saved Bill who tried to play ""catch-up"" with his savings for 30 years! (Business Insider)

Millennials aren't saving today and they aren't going to be able to play catch up later.

A Solution for millennials: Digit; an automatic savings app that analyzes your linked accounts and determines a safe amount to transfer between $5-$50 every few days to a savings account.

2. Millennials pay very high rents

It's an old Financial Adviser rule of thumb that you shouldn't pay more than 30% of your take-home pay for housing. For a millennial earning $60k/year pre-tax, this means that they should spend no more than $1,125/month in rent. But millennials aren't just ignoring this rule, they're destroying it.

In San Francisco, millennials are paying, on average, an absolutely unsustainable 79% of their salary for rent. In Los Angeles, it is 61%. In Boston, 56%. In Seattle, 51% (The Street). It's starting to become more clear exactly why millennials don't have any money to save.

A Solution for millennials: This one is old fashioned. Live with roommates! Either split a 1BR with a significant other or shack up with several roommates in a house. It's the only way to still live in a desirable area of the city (a big want for millennials), while not breaking the bank (at least too badly).

3. Millennials have almost no investments

As we mentioned in the #1 Financial Fail, savings are almost non-existent for my generation. If savings rates are bad for this generation than investing rates are [insert word for bad * infinity].

Nearly 4 in 5 millennials are not investing in the stock market (BusinessWire). While lack of money is a top barrier to investment (41%), there also appears to be a trust boundary, as a large portion of the millennial generation matured during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Over 1/3 of millennials would actually trust an app with their money more than a traditional investment firm.

Why is this so scary?

Because as we mentioned before, the impact of not saving and not investing in the 25-35 age range can be devastating for retirement. Additionally, long-term investing is one of the only ways that you can grow your net worth consistently above the rate of inflation.

Two Solutions for millennials: Acorns and Robinhood.

Fifth of millennials more likely to buy after seeing a video ad,http://www.rapidtvnews.com/2016110945003/fifth-of-millennials-more-likely-to-buy-after-seeing-a-video-ad.html,"Research from video production company Groundbreak Productions has found that 20% of millennials are more likely to purchase a product or service after watching a video advertisement.

The study, which surveyed 1,000 consumers in the UK, also revealed that 42% of consumers like video ads that are informative and 'to the point', and 22% would be more likely to make a purchase after watching this kind of video content.

More than 30% of people surveyed like video ads that tell a story, with 29% favouring those that make them feel nostalgic. About 12% said that they would potentially buy a product or service after watching one of these ads.

Perhaps surprisingly, just 8% of consumers like video ads that have one of their favourite celebrities in them, with only 3% more likely to make a purchase after seeing one of these.

""This research really highlights the importance of brands carefully considering the way they use video to advertise their products or services to their target market,"" said Geoff Brooks, CEO at Groundbreak Productions. ""The fact that millennials' spend is most likely to be influenced by video adverts is good news for those businesses targeting these consumers.""

All of that said, older generations are less receptive to video ads. With only 12% of 45-54-year-olds, 13% of 55-64-year-olds, and only 6% of those aged 65 and over said that they would be more likely to purchase a product or service after watching a video ad.

""For those that have different or more varied target markets these statistics shouldn't be off-putting,"" said Brooks. ""Instead of packing in video advertising altogether, the research suggests that to influence consumer spending brands need to create either snappy and 'to the point' adverts, or invest in storytelling.""

He added: ""As marketers increasingly champion digital platforms over print advertising, consumers are being bombarded with more video content than ever. As a result, for brands to get the best return on investment they need to start paying more attention to what consumers actually want from this kind of marketing and adapt their approach accordingly.""

The new study dovetails with research from Unruly. Millennials are more than twice as likely to share ads they like and 23% more likely to enjoy ads they find relevant but are also the demographic most likely to install ad blockers.",2016-11-09,fifth of millennials more likely to buy after seeing a video ad,Fifth of millennials more likely to buy after seeing a video ad,"['buy', 'seeing']","['millennials', 'a video ad']",['fifth'],0.0

Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, gestures as he speaks during a news conference. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg

Weeks rarely get worse for world leaders than the one Shinzo Abe just had.

First, Donald Trump scrapped a trade deal essential to revitalizing Japan's economy, even after Abe scurried to New York to kiss the president-elect's ring. Vladimir Putin made clear he'd been playing Abe with hints Russia might cede some of the disputed Northern Territories. Efforts to cozy up to South Korea's Park Geun-hye are kaput as impeachment beckons. New data showed Abe's much-heralded ploy to end deflation has, four years on, produced zero inflation.

But the real blow to Abenomics was a ManpowerGroup MAN -1.1741906064751482% ManpowerGroup U.S.: NYSE USD86.69 -1.03 -1.1741906064751482% /Date(1480370521129-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 1180617 AFTER HOURS USD86.8467 0.1567 0.18075902641596495% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 3237 P/E Ratio 14.188216039279869 Market Cap 5882415395.88501 Dividend Yield 1.9840812089052948% Rev. per Employee 727848 More quote details and news "" MAN in Your Value Your Change Short position survey showing why it flopped - and how much work Tokyo must do to change the narrative. Turns out, Japan's millennials are the ""least positive"" about their future among the biggest economies, even trailing young Greeks by a wide margin. Fewer than 40% of young Japanese see a successful career ahead, while 37% of millennials fully expect to work until the day they die (compared with an average 12% among the 18 countries in the study). By contrast, 18% of Chinese and 15% of Greeks expect to work until their last breath.

These comparisons tell Abe and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda all they need to know about why Abenomics got so little traction. There's dangerously little confidence in the future, a mindset Abe's policies have done more to entrench than battle.

Abenomics has three parts - monetary easing, fiscal pump-priming and deregulation. We've seen an explosion of easing, and still deflation persists. We've seen a construction boom ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, and wages still stagnate. The problem: phase three, the one most vital to fattening paychecks, competitiveness and job growth, has barely begun. Modest steps to tighten corporate governance, empower women and poke vested interests are too little-little-too-late for aging, rigid Japan. Abe fanned cynicism by promising economically insecure twentysomethings the world, and producing only hints of that vision.

"" It should worry executives at Nomura, Sony and Toyota that Japanese are far less happy with their today and what tomorrow may offer than Greeks suffering a Depression-like funk. ""

As Kuroda's predecessor, University of Chicago disciple Masaaki Shirakawa, told Abe's team in 2012, Japan's deflation is about demographics, not monetary stimulus. The nearly 30% of Japanese over 65 aren't buying homes, cars, computers, designer clothing or lavishing cash on pricy travel, fancy eateries or impulse buying. But, as data show, neither are millennials. They're not consuming to the extent needed for companies to feel comfortable hiking wages or hiring.

People tend to get the governments they deserve, as the old saw goes. In Japan, it's also troubling how little they expect of companies and managers for whom they work. ManpowerGroup finds, for example, that only 55% of Japanese expect to work with ""great"" people, compared with, say, 91% of Brazilian millennials. It should worry executives at Nomura, Sony 6758.TO 0.23728813559322035% Sony Corp.

The answer is taking the weights off the economy's ankles. Abe squandered nearly four years trying to tweak the constitution, globetrotting and joining a Trans-Pacific Partnership that's more about making Washington happy than raising living standards (one Trump just killed). He expended virtually no energy increasing innovation, cultivating entrepreneurship, modernizing education, reducing red tape, opening Japan Inc. to foreign influence, leveling the playing field for women, importing international talent or taking on vested interests.

For example, here's what passes for notable ""reform"" in Abe's Japan: his Liberal Democratic Party asking farm cooperatives to disclose any plans they might, maybe, perhaps have to increase efficiency. No word yet on addressing those 778% rice tariffs. With the demise of TPP, Abe will have to display a level of political will he hasn't shown to upset his party's biggest support bases. More likely, he'll just prod Kuroda to increase the money supply again.

That won't help millennials any more than it'll cheer the over-65 set. Only headline-grabbing steps to restore Japan Inc.'s dynamism and some game-changing inventions that convince young millennials the future is bright can do that. Abe sprinting to Trump Tower to pledge allegiance to the next U.S. leader smacked more of desperation than visionary leadership. Abe would get far more mileage out of ensuring tomorrow's leaders that the national pension system will survive (cuts are being mulled as we speak) amid surging public debt load.

Abe must persuade young Japanese they won't have to pay to care for elderly parents with dead-end jobs that pay less and less. He must loosen labor markets so workers are more innovative, productive and less stressed. And I'd scale back on talk of robots saving Japan; twentysomethings will just save more and spend less if they worry technology will take their jobs.

Until Abenomics wins over millennials, they won't make big-ticket purchases, while fewer get married or have kids. That means uglier demographics, falling further behind China, increased gloom and, yes, more deflation.

Legal & general in £60 million bid to woo women and millennials,https://www.standard.co.uk/business/legal-general-in-60-million-bid-to-woo-women-and-millennials-a3868701.html,"Legal & General is targeting millennials and women in a £60 million ramp-up of its personal investment business.

"Blue monday? maybe not, but millennials dread going back to work",http://www.smh.com.au/national/blue-monday-formula-fake-but-its-true-that-millennials-dread-going-back-to-work-20170114-gtrhf1.html,"For many Australians, Monday will be the first day back at work. Come 9am or thereabouts tomorrow, the relaxing Christmas break will be but a distant memory, replaced by the daily grind of the workplace. More than half of Australians are dreading the thought of going back to the office, and the feeling is more intense the younger you are.

According to a Telstra survey, almost three in four 18 to 24-year-olds are dreading going back to work in the New Year. But that sentiment appears to decline with age - among working baby boomers, less than four in 10 will be dragging their feet come the first day back:

Those over 65 are practically raring to get back into it, and returning to work was a source of dread for only one in five.

Deakin University organisational psychology professor Michael Leiter said younger people were dreading going back to work because they were ""on the short end of the stick"" when it came to meaningful jobs.

""You don't start off in the plumb job too often. This is the gap between what your ideal work world and what your reality is,"" he said.

""Millennials have had a more idealistic perspective of their dream career sold to them,"" he said, ""I think universities are somewhat guilty of this.""

""For generations before, it was probably more cut and dried and practical. We've primed folks to be more impatient, that you get right to that meaningful job straight away.""

Sydney psychologist Jacqui Manning adds that people's unhappiness at work can be highlighted when they have a few weeks off.

""I try to brainstorm with clients all the time with how they can tailor their work days to increase their energy and positivity,"" she said. ""I'm often talking to clients about whether there's a possibility to work from home, even if just for a day or two per fortnight.""

The survey found younger people were also more likely to be thinking about changing jobs and were yearning for more workplace flexibility.

Telstra home and business projects executive director Stuart Bird said advances in internet technology meant it was easier to work from home. ""Kick-starting the conversation with your manager is often all it takes to get the ball rolling,"" he said.

With so many people reluctant to ease back into their regular routines, the first day back at work after Christmas holidays has even been given a name - ""Blue Monday"".

Blue Monday falls on the third Monday in January and is claimed to be the most dreaded and depressing day of the year, with a mathematical formula to prove it.

The date has been gaining in popularity over the past decade, and Google searches for ""Blue Monday"" surge each January.

But while it is probably true that a good proportion of people feel down about going back to work, the idea that Blue Monday has a basis in science is nonsense.

The date was popularised by a PR agency in England to advertise a now defunct TV travel channel. They created a bogus mathematical formula and paid a university maths tutor to put his name to it so media organisations would think it was real.

Are the millennials showing up for the midterms?,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2018/04/03/are-the-millennials-showing-up-for-the-midterms/,"Vince Reinhart/flickr Donate Subscribe Share Tweet Print Email

One of the contributing factors to Hillary Clinton's shocking electoral loss to Donald Trump was her complete failure to mobilize the youth vote, particularly the 18 to 20-year-old segment of the electorate. Perhaps a younger candidate would have related better to them, but Clinton could not shake them out of their apathy. This cohort had their lowest turnout rate on record in the 2014 midterms and were unenthused about their options in 2016.

Things could be much different in the 2018 midterm elections, but it's a little early to say for sure.

It's been more than six weeks since the massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., launched a generation often maligned as self-absorbed and politically apathetic on a fierce campaign for gun control and school safety. Young activists have staged walkouts, led massive rallies throughout the country, taken to social media to challenge lawmakers, and demanded town hall meetings with politicians.

Hoping to sustain their momentum, they are now beginning to focus on the November midterm election.

Young people are one of the biggest untapped forces in U.S. politics.

By next year, millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, are projected to outnumber baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964. But they go to the polls in staggeringly small numbers.

In the 2014 midterm election, turnout among 18- to 20-year-olds was 15%, among the lowest in a national election since the voting age was changed from 21 in 1971.

Working against a mass mobilization of the youth vote is the simple passage of time and the distractions of summer vacation. Yet, there are still seven months for this new generation of political activists to get organized. Voter registration drives are not going to run up against deadlines anytime soon, and models for getting out the message and the vote can be stood up at a fairly leisurely pace.

This is the first generation that grew up entirely within the social media milieu and knows no other way of communicating and organizing. And the Parkland massacre seems to have given them something else that unites them in a time when we're so atomized as individuals that very little thing seems capable of bringing us to together.

The gun issue could become bigger than the things that drove my generation like divestiture from South Africa and the fight against nuclear power. It could become more akin to draft resistance and other forms of antiwar protest during the Vietnam era, or even the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s.

The talent and leadership seems to be present, as well as the tools they'll need. What's working against them is the difficulty of maintaining anyone's focus in our media environment. They won't be able to rely on traditional media to sustain their movement, but maybe they don't need to do that. Donald Trump didn't need newspaper endorsements or favorable coverage or approval from the usual gatekeepers, so why should this generation of organizers be expected to secure those advantages? Perhaps they know how to keep their movement present in the lives of the people because they're experts at the actual media environment we live in rather than the one old people like you and me grew up with that no longer seems to have much juice or sway.

They face a sophisticated, well-funded and ruthless adversary in the National Rifle Association, but the NRA can't prevent them from mobilizing their own generation to vote.

While their movement could sputter out over the summer, it's unlikely that there won't be another mass shooting between now and November to remind people anew that our government has attempted exactly nothing to protect our schoolchildren since Sandy Hook and that the Republicans have been loosening gun regulations everywhere they have to power to do so, including on the Supreme Court.

If we see a big spike in turnout among the youth in November and it results in a change in power in Congress and new gun regulations, that could be first mark of this new generation. But it won't be the last and they'll be heard from either way, and at a younger age than the generations that immediately preceded them.",2018-04-03,are the millennials showing up for the midterms?,Are the Millennials Showing Up for the Midterms?,"['Are', 'Showing']",['the Midterms'],"['are', 'millennials']",1.0
Millennials and their impact on multifamily: doing business without talking,https://www.multihousingnews.com/post/millennials-and-their-impact-on-multifamily-doing-business-without-talking/,"Real estate companies that resist adopting a digital approach will find themselves left behind, trying to speak to prospects, but finding that no one is listening.

Millennials generally expect a digital component to most experiences, whether it's social planning, paying bills, dating, shopping or work. After all, few Millennials can remember a time before the Internet, and for most of their adult lives, they have only needed to reach into their pocket or purse to access it. But even though we call these pocket devices ""smart phones,"" for Millennials (and increasingly for older generations as well), the part of this device they use the least is the phone app.

By and large, Millennials don't want to talk to people. It's rare that I get a phone call from anyone under 40 years old, both in my personal and professional life, unless that call was scheduled or they're trying to sell me something. Today, Millennials want to use an app, a mobile website, texting, Snapchat, or any of a multitude of other means to communicate digitally. And who can blame them? You don't get put on hold or find yourself trapped in a long, unproductive conversation. While waiting for the other party to respond, you can work on other tasks, and there's typically a complete record of the conversation saved if you need to refer back to it. Texting is simply much more efficient.",2018-01-08,millennials and their impact on multifamily: doing business without talking,Millennials and Their Impact on Multifamily: Doing Business Without Talking,"['Doing', 'Talking']","['Multifamily', 'Business']",['millennials'],1.0
Why are millennials putting off marriage? let me count the ways,http://www.patriotledger.com/zz/lifestyle/20160607/why-are-millennials-putting-off-marriage-let-me-count-ways?rssfeed=true,"For many young people across the country, putting off marriage - or even settling down with a partner long term - has become the norm. The average age for first marriage is 27 for women and 29 for men; in urban areas such as New York and Washington, those averages are higher. It seems that everyone has a different answer for why: Blame it on the economy. Or dating apps. Or women's ability to delay childbearing.

But the less sexy answer is that it's all of the above.

""When there's rough economic times, marriage rates go down,"" explains Eric Klinenberg, sociologist and co-author of Aziz Ansari's ""Modern Romance: An Investigation."" ""People don't feel comfortable committing to someone during hardships.""

Marriage is indeed a financial investment, which explains why people in their 20s aren't ready to take the plunge, considering the mounting debts and scarce job prospects they face today.

""We both have student debt, so it's ridiculous,"" Schaefer said. ""And it's a domino effect. Because then what's the next step? Kids? A house? We can't afford that now.""

Shaky finances can keep millennials from tying the knot, even into their 30s. James Fay, a 33-year-old who works in advertising says he and his ex never made it down the aisle because they were still establishing themselves professionally. ""We didn't have our careers established to the point where we thought it was smart to have a wedding and settle down and all that. Now that I'm single again, marriage isn't off the table and my career now is further along, so it's an easier choice.""

It's not all bad news, economically. For women, marriage is less of a financial necessity. ""There a couple of reasons why people choose to get married,"" says Andrew Zuppann, assistant professor of economics at the University of Houston. "" One is to have two people in the household to share the housework and finances. A big change between 2016 and 1950 is that a lot less people rely on this and have opportunities to afford to be on their own.""

We're also better able to delay parenthood. ""Contraceptives and abortion are letting women put off pregnancy and marriage longer,"" Zuppann said. ""In general, the reasons why marriage age is much later now are: birth control, technology, abortion, changes in female pay and household technology, like appliances.""

Fair enough, but what about the effect of internet dating? According to the Pew Research Center, 15 percent of Americans use dating apps these days, a threefold increase for young people since 2013. Surely the rise of ""hookup culture"" is contributing to the number of singles who prefer perpetual use of Tinder and OkCupid, among others, to settling down with a long-term partner.",2016-06-07,why are millennials putting off marriage? let me count the ways,Why are millennials putting off marriage?

Survey finds conservative millennials favor carly fiorina,http://college.usatoday.com/2015/11/23/conservative-millennials-voting-preference/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatodaycomnation-topstories,"Despite her falling poll numbers, businesswomen Carly Fiorina has one group of GOP voters in her corner.

G2 Analytics, an analytics platform that allows users to give real-time feedback during live or recorded events, and the College Republican National Committee conducted a web-based focus group to measure 328 Millennial Republican primary voters' reactions during the Nov. 10 debate hosted by Fox Business Network.

Using a buzzer, participants indicate whether a candidate's answer made them ""more likely"" or ""less likely"" to vote for that particular candidate. What's more, participants answered ""flash poll"" questions during commercial breaks.

The results indicated conservative Millennials are 80.8% ""more likely"" to support after Fiorina after the fourth debate -- the highest of any Republican candidate.

Data courtesy of G2 and College Republicans (Graphic by Collin Brennan)

In fact, according to Real Clear Politics, Fiorina and Sen. Rand Paul - who are ranked seventh and eighth, respectively in a number of national polls -- ranked first and second, respectively, among conservative Millennials following the fourth GOP debate.

Quentin Kidd, Ph. D., the director of the Judy Ford Wason Center for Public Policy and vice provost at Christopher Newport University, doesn't find Fiorina's popularity among conservative Millennials surprising.

""Fiorina debates well, that is really clear, and these are likely Republican Millennial voters and, in my mind, they are attracted to strong debate performances,"" says Kidd. ""Millennials, in general, are interested in diverse candidates, and they are probably attracted to Fiorina because she is a woman and a strong and confident one at that.""

Another big takeaway from the data: how little front-runner Donald Trump stood out for conservative Millennials. Trump ranked seventh among Republican Millennials at 70.4% -- only ahead of the former Ohio governor John Kasich by 4.5% .

""Trump's support is built on the Tea Party movement and the white middle class,"" says Kidd. According to Gallup, people under the age of 30 make up just 15% of the tea party movement.

""The Tea Party movement never attracted a large number of conservative Millennials. It was mostly made up of middle age white voters. So, to me, it is no surprise to see Trump at the lower end of the spectrum,"" says Kidd.

Despite Fiorina's success and Trump's shortcomings with younger voters, the data indicates most conservative Millennials have yet to commit to a candidate, with 57.14% saying they haven't decided who to vote for in the primary elections.

Data courtesy of G2 and College Republicans (Graphic by Collin Brennan)

""I think this reflects the volatility in the Republican primary,"" says Kidd. ""When you have 14 candidates it is really hard for people to feel firm about who they are going to vote for. I am actually surprised to see that many people who have decided who they are going to vote for at this early point in the process. ""

Dr. Kidd believes Millennials indecisiveness mirrors that of all Republican voters. And, according to Kidd, that indecision can favor a certain type of GOP candidate.

""I think it favors an establishment Republican,"" says Kidd. ""If you have six out of 10 conservative Millennials who say they don't know who they are going to vote for, It means they are not comfortable with those who are currently leading the pack, principally Donald Trump.

""Conservative Millennials are essentially saying 'we don't like who the leaders are'.""

Although the Iowa Caucus is three months away, Kidd thinks there is still some room for candidates like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio to catch the two front-runners in Carson and Trump.

""In the end, it's going to be an establishment Republican who has the money to go the distance,"" says Kidd. ""The candidate who can speak about basic economic issues and be optimistic with that message, be competent in foreign policy, and avoid getting mired in social issues is going to be the candidate that conservative Millennials -- and the general election population -- are going to be attracted to. But that is a fine thread to weave.""

"Millennials, not baby boomers, must transform america",http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/civil-rights/309639-millennials-not-baby-boomers-must-transform-america,"The 2016 election brought the United States a whirlwind of events, with one being particularly notorious: the election of a former reality television star-turned populist politician to the presidency of the United States.

Election coverage post-mortems all highlight the orange makeup, pantsuits, and lost emails. But 2016 is more than that - it is a lesson for the beltway elites, and proves that America must focus on its future, not yesterday's policies, politicians and voting blocs.

From Brexit, to the slow lifting the embargo on Cuba, to the death of taxis via Uber, the world around us is changing, and it's time we evolve and adapt. If there was one word to describe 2016 in a nutshell, it would be unpredictable.

If there was one hope for 2017, it should be opportunity.

Few Americans express trust in any of the institutions at play: Congress, the mainstream media, and the two main political parties. Often, the officials who run in these circles are distracted from the issues by grandiose personalities and individual incentives.

Instead, we must look to the county's entrepreneurs and youth for innovative ideas, and we must be willing to sit down at the table with even our most polar of opposites. That's what American is all about; a real dialogue about the problems we face as a society and relying on people -- not government -- to create solutions.

It doesn't matter whether you identify as Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Green, Constitutionalist, or independent. This is not time to whine or celebrate the election results. It's time to focus on what matters.

What matters is that we push a positive narrative based on human respect that creates opportunity for all.

1. A sober foreign policy of non-intervention

2. Real criminal justice reform/ending the failed war on drugs

7. Lowering taxes so all American's can keep more of the money they work hard to earn

The aforementioned issues are millennial issues. These exact issues are barely touched by establishment politicians - and it's not going unnoticed. Young people want a fair shot, and that means getting the government out of the way.

Millennials are now tied with Baby boomers for the largest voting bloc. We're entering the workforce, paying taxes, and more importantly, we're questioning the status quo. Millennials don't fit into the conventional left-right mold. They want, and need, something different.

At the end of the day, millennials are the ones picking up the pieces of the crumbling infrastructure, mounting national debt, and egregious violations of our civil liberties. Sure, we could sit back and complain about how inefficient, corrupt, and inept government has become - but that's nothing new.

People, not politicians, create solutions. This is a call to action for all young Americans... let's rise up, stop bickering, and work hard to create solutions that will fix the problems that government can't.

This is how long millennials have to save to afford a home in austin,http://austin.culturemap.com/news/real-estate/04-20-16-apartment-list-2016-renter-survey-millennials-affordability-buying-homes/,"Buying a home in Austin is increasingly challenging. There aren't many starter homes available, and even if there were, a new report says millennials wouldn't be able to snag them.

As part of an annual survey, Apartment List questioned millennial renters across the country about their plans for homeownership. The Austin metro area lines up with the national trend: A lot of young people want to buy a place, but they can't afford to right now, and they may not be able to any time soon.

Eighty-two percent of metro-area millennials plan to buy a home, but most say they need at least three years to prepare. Affordability is cited as the main reason for holding off, not surprising to anyone who's looked at the Austin market as of late.

While millennials understand that the market is pricey, they are underestimating what it will take to buy a home. Survey respondents think they need $23,194 for a down payment, but data from Trulia says first-time buyers should have $31,700 in the bank, 20 percent of the median price of an Austin-area starter home.

These perspective homebuyers have a long road ahead. Local respondents report having $2,910 in savings, with plans to contribute $194 each month. Based on the savings rate and down payment requirements, they'll need to save for almost 10 years to buy a home.

Austinites are not alone, as the disconnect is seen across the country. ""Many do not seem to realize their financial predicament -- 3 in 4 renters plan to purchase a home within the next five years, but their savings trajectories suggest that they may need a decade or more to afford it,"" says Apartment List.

The delay in first-time home purchases is part of what Apartment List calls an ongoing affordability crisis that is shaping the future of the housing market.

""Some may choose to delay settling down and having children, while others will migrate to family-friendly cities on the interior of the country. Given the size of the millennial population, either scenario will have a profound impact on homeownership and renting in our society.""",2016-04-20,this is how long millennials have to save to afford a home in austin,This is how long millennials have to save to afford a home in Austin,"['is', 'have', 'save', 'afford']","['a home', 'Austin']","['this', 'is', 'millennials']",1.0
"Goodbye, empty nest: nearly a third of millennials live with parents",http://www.pantagraph.com/news/national/goodbye-empty-nest-nearly-a-third-of-millennials-live-with/article_dec8a977-4903-5bf4-9e43-76f489270baf.html,"WASHINGTON -- Many of America's young adults appear to be in no hurry to move out of their old bedrooms.

For the first time on record, living with parents is now the most common arrangement for people ages 18 to 34, an analysis of census data by the Pew Research Center has found.

Nearly one-third of millennials live with their parents, slightly more than the proportion who live with a spouse or partner. It's the first time that living at home has outpaced living with a spouse for this age group since such record-keeping began in 1880.

The remaining young adults are living alone, with other relatives, in college dorms, as roommates or under other circumstances.

The sharp shift reflects a long-running decline in marriage, amplified by the economic upheavals of the Great Recession. The trend has been particularly evident among Americans who lack a college degree.

The pattern may be a contributing factor in the sluggish growth of the U.S. economy, which depends heavily on consumer spending. With more young people living with their parents rather than on their own, fewer people need to buy appliances, furniture or cable subscriptions. The recovery from the 2008-09 recession has also been hobbled by historically low levels of home construction and home ownership.

As recently as 2000, nearly 43 percent of young adults ages 18 to 34 were married or living with a partner. By 2014, that proportion was just 31.6 percent.

In 2000, only 23 percent of young adults were living with parents. In 2014, the figure reached 32.1 percent.

The proportion of young adults now living with their parents is similar to the proportions that prevailed from 1880 through 1940, when the figure peaked, Pew found. Yet in those decades, the most common arrangement for young adults was living with a spouse rather than with parents.

""We've simply got a lot more singles,"" said Richard Fry, lead author of the report and a senior economist at the Pew Research Center. ""They're the group much more likely to live with their parents.""

The typical U.S. woman now marries at 27.1 years old, the typical man at 29.2, according to census data. That's up from record lows of 20.1 for women and 22.5 for men in 1956.

""They're concentrating more on school, careers and work and less focused on forming new families, spouses or partners and children,"" Fry said of the millennials.

The shift may also be disrupting the housing market. One mystery that has confounded analysts since housing began to recover in 2012 is why there aren't more homes for sale. The lack of available houses has driven up prices and made it less affordable for many would-be purchasers to buy homes.

Nela Richardson, chief economist at real estate brokerage Redfin, says one explanation for the sparse supply is that many baby boomers aren't able to sell their family homes and downsize for retirement because they still have adult children living with them. Redfin recently surveyed homeowners ages 55 to 64 and found that one-fifth still have adult children at home.

""Because there are so many boomers and so many millennials, it's having a big effect on the housing market,"" Richardson said.

Among young men, declining employment and falling wages are another factor keeping many of today's 18-to-34-year-olds unmarried, Fry said. The share of young men with jobs fell to 71 percent in 2014, the report found, from 84 percent in 1960 -- the year when the proportion of young adults living outside the home peaked.

Incomes have fallen as well: Wages, adjusted for inflation, plunged 34 percent for the typical young man from 2000 to 2014.

Other factors contributing to the trend of living with parents range from rising apartment rents to heavy student-debt loads to longer periods in college.

Many analysts had expected that as the economy improved, younger adults would increasingly move out on their own. That hasn't happened. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, says soaring rents are discouraging some millennials from leaving their parents' homes.

Kolko's research, based on more recent data, has found that the share of young adults living with their parents in the first quarter of 2016 was essentially unchanged from two years earlier.

Median rents nationwide were surging at a 6 percent annual pace as recently as August, though they have slowed since. In fast-growing cities like San Francisco, Denver, and Portland, Oregon, rents rose last year at a double-digit pace.

Heavier student debt loads have sent more young people back to their parents' nests, according to research last year by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Other economists aren't convinced that student debt plays a dominant role. They note that the proportion of young adults without college degrees who live with parents is especially high: Nearly 39 percent of those with only a high school degree were living with a parent in 2014, up from around 26 percent in 2000.

That compares with just 19 percent of young adult college grads living at home in 2014. That figure, though, is up sharply from 11 percent in 2000.

Millennials offer opportunities for growth - inquirer business,http://business.inquirer.net/219240/millennials-offer-opportunities-for-growth,"Millennials looking to their own homes or units tend to consider at least five factors which include the payment terms, amenities that would suit their lifestyles, and proximity to key establishments and institutions.

It can be a fickle, high risk market. But the returns can also be quite rewarding.

If property developers play their cards right, the millennials, whether they choose to rent or purchase a home or unit, can comprise a highly lucrative market, offering numerous opportunities for further growth and expansion.

As it is, the millennial market may have already been contributing a hefty third of the total property sales over the last five years, Ateneo program director for real estate Enrique Soriano III, explained in a recent interview.

This particular market is what he described to be an ""instant, everything, 24/7, one click demographic market with ages ranging from 22 to 35 years old.""

""For property developers there is a world of difference in marketing houses to the millennial market. The millennial or yuppie market is (a) huge market... It is very tempting but admittedly a high risk and fickle market,"" Soriano said.

""It is not just an attractive but (also a) lucrative segment to tap. But developers must probe deeper into (the millennials') insights. They demand independence yet they may not be financially ready by virtue of their current salary grade -- thus, their preference in renting over owning a home or unit. This is a natural step to eventually buying their own home in the future,"" he further explained.

Although renting has become the more practical choice, millennials also have certain expectations should they decide to buy a home instead. And their choice, Soriano said, would hands down be a condominium unit.

So what then are the biggest considerations of today's millennials when they hunt for their own crib? Soriano ticks off five factors that weigh heavily in one's decision.

According to Soriano, the millennials' top choice would be to live in a thriving, mixed-use community interfused with residential projects, offices, and commercial areas as these make living in a condominium unit highly convenient. An MRT linkage would be a major come-on also for millennials on the prowl for a place to reside.

Emotion and aspirations

Purchasing a condo unit is most likely an emotional and aspirational decision for many yuppies today and weighing heavily in their decision as to which development to favor would be the different amenities offered by the developer.

Such features should be able to cater to the whims and tastes of the target market, which may include, for instance, having bigger pools and party areas, a grand lobby, and functional units.

These configurations may be relatively smaller than the standard unit sizes but the functionality and aesthetics inside the units must be given importance by designers, Soriano explained.

Stretched payment terms

The mode of payment must be reasonable enough for this market to embrace the project. Millennials expect rents to be reasonable but are inclined to go for those that offer lower than current industry rates, at least in terms of the amount for advance rent and security deposit.

For home purchase, a lower equity or downpayment is highly appealing and often, the deal breaker would be the longer term or amortization schedule. Soriano pointed out that a stretched payment ""is and will always be a cash flow concern for the millennial or (prospective) homeowner.""

Furnished units

A unit that already has the necessary furnishings is always a plus for many prospective buyers as this will allow the millennial market to move in right away sans the hassle of fitting out or furnishing the pad.

It will be a disservice to this market if it is provided a bare unit as it often takes at least weeks to fully furnish a pad, he added.

Tech-savvy community

With the millennials growing up in the advent of technologies such as the Internet, they expect their residential communities of choice to be thriving, wireless places that could serve their modern necessities.

According to Soriano, the pioneering developments that have practically changed the landscape and paved the way for a thriving millennial township would be Megaworld Corp.'s Eastwood City in Quezon City, which was eventually followed by the McKinley Hill township, the Newport and Resorts World, and then the booming communities inside the Bonifacio Global City like the Serendra, Forbes Town Center.

Add to that the slew of pocket developments inside traditional central business districts of Ayala Corp., as well as the different projects with direct access to the MRT stations.

Cebu and Iloilo developments of top developers Megaworld and Ayala are also quietly shaping up as millennial communities that will go on stream in the next five years, Soriano further said.

What india's love for a world war ii-era motorbike says about its millennials,https://qz.com/india/1438810/enfield-bullets-popularity-says-a-lot-about-indian-millennials/,"The world's oldest motorcycle brand, Royal Enfield, is an unlikely millennial success story.

The iconic bike is a massive hit with young Indians. Sales have risen from a meagre 20,000 in 2010 to 740,000 units in the eleven months ending February 2018. The Chennai-based manufacturer's success is not just about image and engineering. It represents an ability to understand the experiential nature of the millennial mindset.

The retail experience is slick and compelling. A regular flow of new models and customisations keep showrooms fresh. A formidable feeling of community exists among owners, and Royal Enfield has built on that with a host of events, including Himalayan adventures that create a sense of belonging and shared purpose. Royal Enfield is more than a means of transport.

In its depiction of transportation as a lifestyle choice, Royal Enfield seems to have found a compelling blend of tradition and modernity. Its parent company, Eicher Motors, has been richly rewarded with a share price that matches the muscular image of its two-wheelers.

India's millennials, midnight's grandchildren, are a cohort born in the two decades before 2000. They came of age in the post-1991 era of liberalisation and their experience contrasts sharply with the scarcity, austerity, and lack of opportunity that marked the lives of their parents and grandparents -- midnight's children, as Salman Rushdie famously titled the progeny of Independence. For midnight's grandchildren, the world offers unmatched opportunity and an abundance of choice.

The tension between the generations in India is profound. Traditional hierarchies are being challenged and old certainties are crumbling. New paradigms are emerging. But the line between tradition and modernity is porous: progressive in some attitudes, this generation remains acutely conservative in others.

India is experiencing a unique moment, and the response is uniquely Indian.

India's millennials, like many in other emerging economies, are optimistic about their future in a way their contemporaries in developed markets are not. Young Indians can realistically expect to be financially better off than their parents. Their western peers no longer have that guarantee. Other factors also differentiate the groups.

In the west, an ongoing series of social, economic, and political revolutions have unfolded in the seven decades since the second world war. The delta of change between one generation and the next has been incremental. In India, where there have been just two moments of transformation in the same period, the delta of change is vast and unprecedented. This means there are few models or frames of reference for any of the participants to fall back on.

The new rules are as yet unwritten and many Indian millennials are ill-prepared to navigate the changes swirling around them. Institutions -- family, marriage, workplace, brands, and economic models -- are all being disrupted. Young Indians, like their international contemporaries, are characterised as less beholden to tradition and more willing to challenge authority. In certain areas of life, that's a fair assessment.

Midnight's grandchildren now make up 440 million of the country's population. They are about to become the majority of the nation's workers and the engine of the much-hyped demographic dividend.

The idea of a job for life, a one-company career, belonged to past generations, for whom career progression, albeit slow, was an important point of surety in a world of uncertainty. Young workers want to expedite their progress up the ladder. They are less inclined to defer gratification, and gladly jump ship if their demands are not met. In the workplace, command and control leadership is questioned. ""India's middle managers are having a tough time,"" says R Nanda, chief human resources officer, Tata Chemicals, who is transforming structures and policies in response to new employee expectations.

Relationships with brands are evolving at pace. Notions of loyalty are being rethought as an explosion of consumer choice coincides with new attitudes to spending, which are less inhibited and bound by sanction. For new consumers with little past experience, the plethora of choice is at once exciting and confusing.

Some brands are realising that to capture a share of this fast-moving market they must offer more than the provision of goods and services. They have the potential to meet other psychosocial needs related to the desire for independence and can play a role in shaping the identities of young people in this period of seismic change.

And yet, there are areas where millennials stubbornly cling to the convention.

In their romantic lives, midnight's grandchildren are finding novel ways to handle this clash of tradition and modernity. Many are comfortable with a Tinder or Hinge date on a Friday night and then willingly sit down for coffee with the ""arranged marriage boy,"" or girl, on a Saturday.

Despite the flirtation with dating apps, more than 85% of Indians choose arranged marriages, obdurately contradicting the predictions of development theorists who believed that western models of personal choice or ""love marriage"" would prevail. When it comes to tying the knot, it seems tradition holds the trump card. An Indian millennial's desire for autonomy often plays second fiddle to a need to conform to social norms and a fear of being an outcast.

This, then, is the conundrum at the heart of India's millennial moment. Emboldened by new economic opportunity and spoilt for choice, they yet choose to cling to the past.",2018-10-26,what india's love for a world war ii-era motorbike says about its millennials,What India's love for a World War II-era motorbike says about its millennials,['says'],"['What', 'a World War II-era motorbike', 'its millennials']","['love', 'says']",0.0

Bobbi Rebell reports.

Harley-Davidson having a rough ride today shares down sharply after the company cut its profit outlook and announced it will be cutting jobs. Probably in these CO covers the company at wonder let's securities and joins us with more great to have you. Thank you so much are so what is going on at Harley that had a bad year altogether back. Yeah they really have it all started about a year ago when the Japanese currency. Early changed so dramatically pursue US dollar and the primary competitors are obvious which that's Honda Yamaha Kawasaki Suzuki on manufacturing and weeks. Every week of bikes. In Japan so that should now have a significant cost to actually start off promoting discounting heavily. That eat into its market share and now most recently they're great the Japanese are aggressively launching new products around the world. That's further eating it to him on his team it's its market share all of whom. They're vice once again from around the produced here in the states. So the plan now is to cut jobs put that money marketing a product development is that the rates strategy. We'll look. Term there really need to try to figure out the answer to spend as much. It's certainly investing. Increasing investment decisions myself. And my visas and all the right stuff tastes he could to take some time that this could be a multi year practice just try to regain its market share. They've been up to the Japanese you just in the last few months. And of course Wall Street not I was so patient they Lampard corner so in terms of the stock took a huge hit today on this news what's your take there. Well I think ultimately. Even as the continued disappointment that of the new products which they launch for next here are just not resonating with consumers feel. Did unveiled several new products in August for the 2016 model year. And that the initial read just doesn't seem to be on a positive in terms of their ability to stem market share decline. And at the same time the Japanese continue to be very aggressive not just with discounts but also with new product launches. So what's your recommendation on the stock we had this level and it is it is it a good value out at a car down so much ultimately even with facilities. Filled with the. This system silence. Enough for the launching sponsors. No big wait until next. Yes of course played totally lost its track against future.

And in fact they did talk about the fact that operating margins have been under pressure they they are also facing some big picture things that are not really in control of the truth as the world is changing. Demographic trends are not in their favor. There's a list of the United States. One of the key issues that Harley faces and really the entire motorcycle industry faces in the United States. Is he aging demographic colonials. People who twenties and thirties to start riding motorcycles the way to these 50s60s girls.

"Workers are saving more for retirement, led by millennials",http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Workers-are-saving-more-for-retirement-led-by-6742551.php,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Workers are saving more for retirement, and the youngest -- not exactly known for squirreling money away -- are boosting their savings rates faster than any other age group.

Millennials between the ages of 25 and 34 are saving a median of 7.5 percent of their pay for retirement, including whatever match they get from their jobs, according to a survey by Fidelity Investments of 4,650 households with at least $20,000 of annual income. That's up from 5.8 percent two years ago, when the last survey was conducted, and it is the largest jump among all age groups.

That's still not enough, but at least the trend is getting better. Financial advisers suggest socking away 15 percent of pay, and more if workers haven't saved in their earlier years.

Younger workers had the most room for improvement, because they were saving such a pittance. Older workers were already saving more of their paychecks. Workers aged 35 to 50 are now socking away 8.2 percent of their income, up from 7.7 percent two years ago. The oldest workers, aged 51 to 69, are saving 9.7 percent, up from 8.1 percent.

Several reasons are behind the rise, said John Sweeney, executive vice president of retirement and investment strategies at Fidelity, including an improving job market and economy. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 2008, and workers are feeling more comfortable in their jobs and with their finances.

Some workers are also saving more without knowing it, because their 401(k) and other retirement plans are automatically enrolling them and increasing how much they contribute each year.

Those programs tend to put contributions into a target-date mutual fund, one that takes care of how much to invest in stocks versus bonds based on how close an investor is to retirement. That means workers also generally have more appropriately balanced accounts than a couple years ago, Fidelity says. A target-date fund prevents a 20-something worker -- who has the luxury of decades to go before retirement -- from investing only in bonds, which are safer but have historically offered lower long-term returns.

The survey was Fidelity's attempt at measuring how prepared workers are for retirement. Fidelity looked at how much workers make, spend and save, as well as when they expect to retire, among other factors. It found that 45 percent are likely to afford at least their essential expenses in retirement, up from 38 percent two years ago.

Older workers are the most prepared for retirement, and not just because they've had longer to save. One reason is that older workers are more likely to have access to pensions, which guarantee income in retirement but have become rare in the workplace.

Older workers also seem to have more realistic expectations than those fresh out of school.

""The further you are from retirement, the more you still hold aspirations of retiring early,"" Sweeney said. ""Boomers are saying it may make sense to continue to work and extend that retirement date from 62 to 65 or 67.""",2016-01-07,"workers are saving more for retirement, led by millennials","Workers are saving more for retirement, led by Millennials","['are', 'saving', 'led']","['retirement', 'Millennials']","['workers', 'saving']",0.0
"Appealing to millennials, las vegas gets e-sports arena",http://lacrossetribune.com/business/appealing-to-millennials-las-vegas-gets-e-sports-arena/article_b56ca583-c0d8-51d2-98f7-067ee213692f.html,"LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The arena has all the features that a professional sports venue needs: stands, warm-up areas for teams, massive screens for spectators and a broadcast platform for commentators. But what distinguishes this new Las Vegas arena is its dozens of video game consoles.

The 15,000-square-foot e-sports venue slated to open Friday will host competitive video game tournaments. It's part of a trend that the casino industry hopes will attract the millennial crowd, the 15- to 34-year-olds who are becoming majority spenders in today's economy but aren't necessarily interested in traditional gambling.

""Las Vegas needs to consistently reinvent itself to remain relevant to the up-and-coming generation,"" said Seth Schorr, CEO of Fifth Street Gaming and a member of the board of directors of Millennial Esports, the company behind the arena. ""We've always come up with ways to maintain our position as the entertainment capital of the world.""

Athletes participating in a tournament at the arena will emerge from a tunnel surrounded by roaring crowds in the stands. They will then go on a podium and sit at stations equipped with game consoles, monitors and other equipment.

The venue will open its doors March 3 with a three-day, $50,000-prize-pool Halo World Championship qualifier and host an EA Sports-sanctioned Madden 17 NFL tournament later in March.

The arena is within walking distance of downtown hotel-casinos. It will host 200 people in stadium-style seating overlooking the main stage, but hundreds more can be accommodated in another hall outfitted with screens showing the live competition. The entire facility was built in an area that once housed movie theaters and a nightclub.

More than 3 miles of CAT cable were needed to wire the facility. Its dozens of ports offer internet speeds of one-gigabit. When no tournaments are in progress, the facility will be open to casual gamers and others interested in using the high-speed internet.

Las Vegas casinos have invested in numerous non-gaming amenities to attract the elusive millennials, from rooms with bunk beds for the young travelers who don't want to spend a minute apart to a lounge that features pool, foosball and air hockey. The Downtown Grand, a short walk from the new arena, has an e-sports lounge, where tournament competitors, casual gamers and fans play and socialize.

""The younger people don't get enamored by the glitz and the glitter of something; it's all about authenticity for them,"" said Alex Igelman, CEO of Millennial Esports.

Vegas is betting on e-sports as its popularity has evolved from a niche genre of gaming to a lucrative sport thanks to new technologies, more reliable internet speeds and a generation of gamers that has grown up watching competitive matches on YouTube and other sites. Nevada sportsbooks have already taken wagers on matches.

The sport now draws tens of millions of spectators to online platforms and real-world venues, including New York City's Madison Square Garden, the Los Angeles' Staples Center and Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena, which earlier this month saw 16 of the world's best CS:GO teams compete. Estimates show 323 million people watched e-sports in 2016. The global audience is expected to grow to 385 million this year.

""E-sports no longer needs to be legitimized; it's a huge sport already,"" said Mike Sepso, co-founder of Major League Gaming. ""There are e-sports fans everywhere in this country.""

REVELLERS are ditching the booze on stag dos because they want to remember the experience so they can post it to Instagram, a new study has found.

The research comes as a report found Brits were guzzling less alcoholic drinks now than they were 10 years ago.

The ""dry stag do"" has surged in popularity because punters want to remember the night.

Nikkayla Henricksen of Ultimate Recreation said: ""Insta-stags are driving a change in the way we think about a night out. Stag groups are increasingly opting for a more memorable experience rather than drinking.

""They're turning the experience into something tangible, where the memory of the activity and the time spent with friends becomes something more valuable.

Luxury apartment complex for millennials opens in downtown san jose,https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/08/luxury-apartment-complex-for-millennials-opens-in-downtown-san-jose/,"San Jose -- An $88 million luxury apartment complex with ground-floor retail space has opened in downtown's trendy SoFa (South of First Area) District.

Known as The Pierce -- and billed as a ""luxury rental community"" -- the mixed-use development has 232 residences, including studios, one- and two-bedroom apartments, as well as two-bedroom and two-bath townhomes. Rents range from $2,200 to $5,647 a month.

Aimed at the millennial tech crowd, its amenities include an outdoor pool, private patio with barbecue, full gym, club room, catering kitchen and a lobby with works by neighborhood artists, curated by a local art gallery.

The complex ""raises the 'cool' factor of our city and will serve as an anchor for our downtown's southern edge,"" Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a written statement, prior to the Pierce's grand opening Wednesday.

Designed by Steinberg Architects and developed by the Sares Regis Group of Northern California, the development has 4,300 square feet of retail space and features a rooftop installation of thousands of LED lights that will be visible to drivers on Interstate 280 -- and to passengers on flights coming in and out of Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport.

Dubbed the Voxel Cloud, the 3-D light sculpture is part of the Illuminating Downtown Project (IDP) grant program to enhance the downtown cityscape with installations that join art and technology.

The Pierce is situated at 2 Pierce Avenue at Market Street. (West Reed Street borders the project's south side.)

Millennials aid labour campaign,http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/94906126/Young-campaigners-from-US-and-UK-come-to-aid-of-Labour-candidate,"Michael Greenhough, 20, from Manchester in the United Kingdom, said the main campaign focus is to increase Corie Haddock's social media presence.

Two politically charged millennials have travelled to New Zealand to fight for a party they barely know.

David Burch, a 22-year-old American, and Michael Greenhough, a 20-year-old Brit, are left-leaning university students who have come to the country to fight for the Labour Party as part of an international fellowship programme.

Based in Taranaki and housed at New Plymouth Labour candidate Corie Haddock's house, the pair are working both to garner support for the centre-left political party and getting Haddock's name known.

""Our focus since we got here is social media. The young people don't read the paper so we're expanding our social media approach,"" Greenhough said.

Burch proudly chimes in with: ""Hashtag, two ticks labour"", the social media phrase they are using to group their postings about Labour had Haddock on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

READ MORE:

* New Labour party candidate to stand for New Plymouth electorate

* Businesses need good social media policies to manage risk

* New Plymouth Labour Party building strong base amongst growing support

* The serious business of being social

It's also a phrase the two young campaigners wholeheartedly believe in.

""Anything is better than National,"" Burch said.

""The policies and the sound reasoning that we're trying to push forward, like housing, employment and all these things, that's a much better alternative to National's.""

Burch - a student of Wake Forest University in North Carolina - hails from a ""red state"", where voting Republican is the norm.

But that didn't stop him engaging in a brief stint helping the Democratic National Committee and being involved in organising rallys and events to boost support for candidate Bernie Sanders.

As for Greenhough, he spent time on the campaign trail in 2015 and 2017 for David Hinder, the UK Labour constituent for Ribble Valley in Lancashire county.

Both Hinder and Sanders were unsuccessful but Greenhough said a campaign victory is more than an election win.

""We campaigned to increase our share of the vote, which we did both times so it's considered a success in that aspect,"" he said.

""​But it's a very different culture and different politics here than in the UK.

""Being in New Zealand means we've had to increase our New Zealand politics knowledge.""

The two men said they have had to learn a lot about Maori affairs and felt there were injustices in housing and education that needed to be addressed.

They also pointed to mental health and funding pressures on district health boards (DHBs) around the country.

While Greenhough and Burch found similarities between New Zealand politics and that of of their home country's, there was one unsuspected difference: Kiwis are rather politically informed.

""In my opinion, people here are a little more informed and often times more opinionated,"" Burch said.

""Not only are they informed about their own politics and what's going on around the world, but if I bring up the general election and Trump, they often know more than most Americans would know.""

The young campaigners, who spend a majority of their time door-knocking and cold-calling people of Taranaki, are also teaching Haddock the world of social media.

'millennials don't like to get naked' and other issues affecting the luxury real estate market,http://www.dallasnews.com/business/real-estate/2017/01/23/millennials-like-get-naked-issues-affectingthe-luxury-real-estate-market,"Some real estate amenities are eternal--a sweeping view across Central Park, for instance, or a doorman who knows your favorite driver. Others, though, might prove unexpectedly faddish: What seems like a must-have today could vanish in the developments of tomorrow. Here are four surprising staples of the luxury real estate market that insider experts predict could soon become obsolete.

The home theater market stateside stood at $1.4 billion in 2015, up more than 50 percent since the same period in 2010, per Cedia, a trade association for home technology companies. Of course, it's no longer enough to install a supersize screen and digital projector: True cinephiles can build their own $1 million personal Imax theater and sign up for Prima Cinema, a Netflix-like service for the 1 percent that allows rentals of first-run movies at $500 a pop.

It could prove to a shortsighted investment, though, at least according to architect Duan Tran of KAA Design. ""Our clients are requesting fully immersive, VR environments because they're super-busy and want the highest forms of escapism,"" Tran confides by phone from his office in Los Angeles.

One current project, commissioned by a man the architect calls ""a real techie, who likes to geek out,"" involved simply stripping down the erstwhile maid's room in his home, turning it into a 20-foot-by-20-foot shell as the venue for his own personal Holodeck. ""There, he can throw on a pair of VR goggles and immerse himself completely. Imagine taking a walk on the beach in the Bahamas, or a walk down to the Arc de Triomphe on Saturday afternoon before dinner.""

Tech advances have propelled this blue-sky idea into brick-and-mortar reality, such as the relatively affordable VR cubes and screens from such companies as Virtalis. Tran explains that changing building codes in overbuilt areas such as L.A. could also have an effect moving this forward. ""They're starting to restrict the size of houses, so when clients request bells and whistles--a 20-car garage, say--we need to be more efficient with space,"" he says. ""Right now, you might need to have 1,000 square feet dedicated to a home theater,"" but in the future, ""it could be a 6-foot-by-6-foot room for the same programming.""

Sprawling master suites were once the ultimate trophy asset in a luxury home, but recent developments have begun replacing the open-plan, loft-like rooms with a complex of private chambers, jigsawed together around a smaller, cozy space that's home solely to a bed. Douglas Elliman's Roy Kim points to Miami's Rem Koolhas-designed Park Grove as an example. ""You'll see an antechamber, like a study, or a library, plus a large dressing area and a spa-like bathroom,"" Kim says by phone from California. ""You no longer want to walk unceremoniously into a master bedroom and see the bed--creating privacy is more important than ever.""

Jonah Disend, founder of innovation firm Redscout, explains further: ""The concept of a master bedroom is becoming obsolete because we have a different relationship with sleep now--we don't hang out in the bedroom the way we used to."" Disend notes that millennials are driving this shift. Their relationship with privacy is radically different from those of the generations preceding them--though digitally nonchalant, they're prudish in person.

""Millennials don't like to get naked--if you go to the gym now, everyone under 30 will put their underwear on under the towel, which is a massive cultural shift,"" he continues. As gym designers are adapting, so are condo developers. ""They want their own changing rooms and bathrooms, even in a couple.""

The same instinct is driving the renewed boom in so-called accessory apartments, typically a second, studio home purchased by wealthy couples in the same luxury development where they live, so that boomeranging 20-somethings can enjoy full privacy when moving back in with mom and dad.

Even when they live with peers, these new privacy preferences are changing the layout of apartments, according to Teresa Ruiz of SB Architects. ""We're seeing a shift in household formation, with a lot of co-habitation by renters,"" she says by phone from her office in San Francisco. For one local developer, Avalon, Ruiz says the average age of a renter is 30 years old, with an average income of $300,000. ""The private space they want may be smaller, but they want a larger unit as a whole, so we're making two bedrooms with a den and an extra bathroom."" Translation: They'll share a sofa but are squeamish if ever asked to split the sink.

According to the number-crunchers at McKinsey, ride-sharing and driverless cars will reduce the space allocated to parking vehicles by 25 percent come 2050, a reduction that represents more than 61 billion square feet of extra living room. And we're already seeing buildings that anticipate this shift, says Joel Dixon of real estate startup Compass. For example, floor-to-ceiling heights in garages are increasing, to make it easier to convert parking spots to office or residential use at a later time. Likewise, footprints are shrinking so that every corner receives natural light--again, essential for adaptive reuse. Elsewhere, future-proofed buildings with flexible spaces that allow garages to be repurposed are already appearing.

""Parking floors aren't angled with ramps as they used to be, either,"" Joel adds, by phone from his office in New York. ""Instead, they use speed bumps to slow traffic, which is also much easier to adapt for future reuse.""

L.A. was a pioneer of this shift, thanks to the Adaptive Reuse Ordinance of the 1990s. To encourage development of vacant commercial buildings into housing, these rules exempted buildings from onerous minimum parking requirements--and so prepped the luxury homes within for the shared-ride boom. In Miami, Herzog & de Meuron's 1111 Lincoln Road fuses residential, office, retail, and parking in a single structure, the idea being that as zoning requirements evolve, autonomous vehicle use increases, and behavior patterns shift, the building would be able to react. Likewise, at Government Center in Boston, a 2,130-vehicle parking garage will be replaced by two 500-foot luxury towers--with only 600 spaces open to the public.

Of course, as garages shrink, one related amenity is expanding: With more vehicles lining up to wait or drop residents at home, a lavish driveway is more essential than ever.

According to Redscout's Disend, elaborate, centerpiece kitchens, like master suites, are another amenity on the endangered list in high-end homes. In part, it's because delivery services such as Blue Apron or Amazon Prime Now will minimize the need to store anything but the bare minimum at home, coupled with such new amenities as centralized cooking and catering within a development. Take Rafael Viñoly's 437 Park Avenue, where Michelin-starred chef Shaun Hergatt will operate a residents-only restaurant, providing the ultimate in luxury takeout.

Disend also identifies the rise of 3D printing as fundamental to this change. ""Soon--I'd expect [in] around two or three years' time--you will be able to create specific housewares for a dinner party when you throw it,"" he says, minimizing the need for storage; Disend himself has even invested directly in 3D printing startup Othr for exactly these reasons.

"Shocker, millennials are being blamed for the death of american cheese",https://www.cosmopolitan.com/food-cocktails/a23791996/american-cheese-decline-sales-millennials/,"Millennials are blamed for many things -- like the decline of paper napkins and of cereal sales, and even killing mayonnaise. But a new Bloomberg report takes the accusations a step further, claiming the generation is behind the death of the country's most beloved patty topper: American cheese.

Why? Apparently, millennials want ingredients they can pronounce and recognize, which makes them steer clear of processed foods like American cheese, which has been a favorite in the U.S. for generations. But these days, American cheese, according to the report, is quite literally ""melting away.""

And maybe for good.

Prices for processed American cheese have been dipping below $4 a pound for the first time in seven years, according to the Bloomberg report. While the number of cheese factories in the country increased by 40 percent between 2000 and 2017, that growth came from smaller cheesemakers with more specific specialties.

Consumers are reportedly shying away from mass-produced cheese and opting for fancier cheeses instead. U.S. sales of American cheese from brands like Kraft Singles and Velveeta are projected to drop 1.6 percent this year.

And food chains are listening across the country. Wendy's is offering asiago alternatives, McDonald's uses a cheese that doesn't contain artificial preservatives, and Cracker Barrel no longer has their old-fashioned grilled cheese.

Panera Bread replaced the American in their own grilled cheese with a four-cheese combo of fontina, cheddar, Monteau, and smoked Gouda. The result, according to the report, has been higher sales.

The report estimates around 40 percent of U.S. households buy Kraft Singles, but that overall sales are flat. The Kraft Heinz Co. is working on ways to get American cheese into more homes by offering qualities that healthier cheeses can't. For example, Kraft Singles have a distinctive ""melt"" that's perfect for grilled cheese sandwiches.

""Honestly, you can't get that in a natural cheese,"" Peter Cotter, the general manager of cheese and dairy at Kraft Heinz Co, told Bloomberg. ""It's a very unique product. The creamy smooth texture and melt of the cheese. The natural cheeses, they just don't melt that way.""",2018-10-15,"shocker, millennials are being blamed for the death of american cheese","Shocker, Millennials Are Being Blamed for the Death of American Cheese","['Are', 'Being', 'Blamed']","['the Death', 'American Cheese']",['blamed'],0.0
"Toronto dominion bank : nearly a third of millennials ""not at all knowledgeable"" about rrsp savings: poll",http://www.4-traders.com/TORONTO-DOMINION-BANK-1411888/news/Toronto-Dominion-Bank-Nearly-a-third-of-millennials-not-at-all-knowledgeable-about-RRSP-savings-21705034/,"OTTAWA -- Nearly a third of young Canadians admit they are ""not at all knowledgeable"" about retirement savings plans, according to a survey done for TD Bank.

The report also suggested that a large proportion of those aged 18 to 33 are uninformed about what registered retirement savings plans can and cannot be used for.

Only half of those surveyed knew that money in an RRSP could be used to help buy their first home, while just 28 per cent knew it could be used to help further their education later in life under the lifelong learning plan.

The survey also found that many young Canadians believed they could use RRSP savings to pay for many things that are not allowed.

Sixty-four per cent were unaware that RRSP savings could not be used to make a charitable donation and 60 per cent mistakenly believed that they could be used to pay childcare expenses.

Fifty-two per cent also incorrectly believed money in an RRSP could be used to finance a car and half wrongly thought it could be used to help buy a second home.

Linda MacKay, senior vice-president for personal savings and investing at TD Canada Trust, said that the earlier people start saving for retirement, the better off they will be.

""The interesting thing with millennials is they do prioritize retirement as important ... but often don't know how to get started or think their budget can accommodate it,"" she said.

MacKay said starting early, even if the amount is small, can make a significant difference.

""No amount is too small,"" she said.

The online poll done by Environics Research for TD Bank surveyed 2,115 respondents aged 18 or older including 613 between 18 and 33 between Oct. 30 and Nov. 5, 2015.

The polling industry's professional body, the Marketing Research and Intelligence Association, says online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

We all know this, but it is a staggering figure when you analyze stats, and how this socio-economic group is affecting small retailers to Amazon behemoths.

""Given the convergence of Millennials coming-of-heavy-spending-age, and smartphone omniuse and social sharing of news among this demographic, marketers love Millennials. By their very youth, they make themselves more open to new brand identification than their elders. Older groups' brand loyalties are more entrenched, and, in certain spending sectors, they find themselves less acquisitive than career-building, family-forming, identity-still-reaffirming Millennials."" Ken Doctor says in a recent piece for Politico.

Advertisers obviously want to reach them, so snatching Millennials has become a huge priority for almost all news publishers.

Politico goes on to say... ""That Millennials' population, in all its glorious diversity, is huge. At 82 million, it's six million greater in number than the last big population bulge, the self-analyzingest generation, the Baby Boomers.

Think Millennials and news, and you think Vice Media, Buzzfeed, Mic, Ozy, Vox Media, Fusion and Vocativ. These are the companies, in just a few years, which have laid claim to the new turf. At the same time, almost every legacy news company is setting strategy with its use of Facebook particularly, and social and messaging media more generally, to hunt Millennials as well.""

Many of us ""boomers"" have become Quasi-Millennials simply by default. We have to use smart phones and use social media if we want to communicate with that younger demographic. And let's face it, Millennials are the new Boomers {20 years from now}...but who knows what the next 20 years will bring to the technology table?

I predict that someone will develop a mini-micro-chip that will be inserted in your body (probably the brain via a small surgical incision) and when you think of something you need or want, it will be automatically ordered via Amazon, delivered by drone and billed to your unlimited credit card that all banks will offer because everyone will be making millions or billions again...just like Trump said.

""It was great. 10 out of 10,"" East Lansing High School Junior Lena Mefford said.

""It personally gave me the chills,"" Emilie Browell said.

He even inspired a kind of frenzy when he touched a person's hand. ""This guy goes, 'Let me feel the burn,' and he touched it, my fingertips, they're singed,"" one member of the crowd said.

No doubt his speech inspired plenty of social media posts. But, and Sanders addressed this in his speech, can he inspire young people to actually vote?

""There is a perception out there, that I think is becoming increasingly inaccurate, that young people are not going to be involved in the political process,"" the Senator said. ""And that is exactly why you have got to stand up and fight back.""

One Michigan State freshman says not all young people are disengaged. ""I'm 19, and this is my first election, so I will definitely be out voting,"" Jessica Gardener said.

Another man in his 20's says he's worried. Sanders has had popular events in other states, but did not do too well in them on Super Tuesday. ""I wonder sometimes if young people are attached more to his message and just want to see him,"" Dan Shanahan said. ""Or if they actually understand that you need to get out and vote or nothing will happen.""

Regardless, when Sanders talked about things like affordable education, minimum wage,and helping the middle class, the crowd gave him a resounding cheer.

Forget spouses or children  --  many millennials are buying homes for their dogs,http://www.businessinsider.com/forget-having-a-baby-millennials-are-buying-homes-for-their-dogs-2017-8,"I have a few specific occasions earmarked in my savings account: moving in with my boyfriend, a round-trip plane ticket to send my mom to Hong Kong, a wedding and/or a house maybe, and -- my personal favorite -- a puppy fund.

In my mind, I've got my mid-20-something savings priorities in order.

I mean, If you can't name at least 28 reasons why dogs are amazing off the top of your head, have you even met one?

They love you unconditionally, they can cheer up your worst days, and they're the No. 3 reason young people are buying their first homes -- ahead of marriage or having a baby.

According to a new survey out from SunTrust, one-third of millennials who bought their first home said having a better space or yard for a dog was a major factor in their decision.

That compares to 25% of those who said marriage was a motivating factor, and the 19% who needed to make room for baby.

""Millennials have strong bonds with their dogs, so it makes sense that their furry family members are driving homebuying decisions,"" said Dorinda Smith, SunTrust Mortgage President and CEO, in a press release. ""For those with dogs, renting can be more expensive and a hassle; homeownership takes some of the stress off by providing a better living situation.""

It's good that first-time homebuyers are honest with why they're seeking to own a larger space. Keeping those priorities top of mind can only help prepare them with the costs to expect owning a pet as well as owning a home (and how to budget accordingly).

Before you go on saying young people don't have their priorities in order, note that the No. 1 reason millennials bought their first homes, at 66%, was to have more living space as a whole. Another 36% stated building equity an essential part of their first-time homebuying decision.

But as far as our companions, dogs had more weight in homebuying than any other human counterpart. They don't call them man's best friend for nothing.",2017-08-04,forget spouses or children  --  many millennials are buying homes for their dogs,Forget spouses or children  --  many millennials are buying homes for their dogs,"['Forget', 'are', 'buying']","['spouses', 'homes', 'their dogs']","['millennials', 'buying']",1.0
Millennials don't think a trump presidency will affect their wallets,http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/09/pf/taxes/millennials-trump-wallet/index.html,"Millennials don't think a Trump presidency will matter for their wallets.

At least, that's the conclusion reached by a recent survey. Young Americans are among those most likely to think the outcome of the election won't make a difference for their financial security, according to Bankrate.com's December Financial Security Index.

About 45% of respondents aged 18-35 said they think the results of the election won't affect their personal finances either way.

Among Millennial respondents, 22% said they think Trump's presidency will affect their finances in a positive way, and 26% said his win will have a negative impact on their wallets. Another 5% of Millennials polled said they don't know what the election results mean for their finances.

Of those who expect a Trump presidency to be a good thing for their bank accounts, the main drivers cited were lower taxes and higher income. Those who expect Trump to have a poor impact on their wallet pointed to taxes and income as well.

Just over 1,000 people were polled from December 1-4 of this year.

In general, Millennials feel more financially secure than older Americans, said Bankrate.com's Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride. ""They have the highest feeling of job security of any age group, which makes sense given their social media and technology skills,"" McBride said.

Despite this overall sense of security, there are plenty of reasons for Millennials to pay attention to Trump's policies:

Taxes

His latest tax plan is likely to reduce taxes for most people. And while that could be helpful for some single Millennials, those who have children -- or plan to -- could end up paying more.

Trump's plan is likely to result in tax cuts for those who opt for a standard deduction, as many Millennials do, explained Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank.

Currently, unmarried young Americans with no dependents and few assets can claim a $6,300 standard deduction and a personal exemption of $4,050. Trump would kick that standard deduction up to $15,000 and get rid of personal exemptions.

Overall, Cole estimates that Millennials would save a few hundred dollars in taxes.

But Trump's proposed plan could actually raise taxes for some low- and middle-income families.

That's because Trump would raise the lowest tax bracket to 12% from the current 10%. And he would drop personal exemptions and head of household status, which particularly benefits single parents.

But negotiations between Trump's plan and a previous tax reform plan from House Republicans could change the outcome. Bob Williams, Sol Price Fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, warns that it may be too soon to tell what Trump's tax plan will actually look like.

""What Trump's plan is today might not be what Trump's plan is tomorrow,"" he said, adding, ""Will there be another plan? We don't know.""

Health care

Another big consideration for young people: changes to their health care plans. Trump said during his campaign that he would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But in a post-election interview, he said he might preserve some parts of the law. Of the Obamacare measure that lets children stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, Trump said ""we're going to very much try to keep that.""

If Trump does repeal the act outright, millions of young people could see their health care disappear. It's still unclear whether he would put a new plan in place that would prevent those currently on Obamacare from losing their insurance.

According to figures released by the Health department, more than 6 million Americans aged 19 to 25 were insured by the American Care Act since 2010.

Child care

The president-elect also promised to help young parents. Trump stressed the importance of more affordable child care during his campaign.

Under Trump's proposed plan, parents could deduct the average cost of child care in their state, depending on the child's age, for up to four children. That break would apply to any single parent making less than $250,000 per year, or a couple bringing in less than $500,000 annually.

The plan would benefit stay-at-home parents whose spouses work, and offer relief to working parents who wouldn't owe federal income taxes.

Experts fear, however, that some of the provisions -- like tax breaks on dependent care savings accounts -- would end up helping upper- and middle-class families but offer little to low-income parents.

Student debt

Trump has proposed an income-based cap on student loans that would limit graduates' payments to 12.5% of their salaries. He's also said that graduates would see their debts forgiven after 15 years of regular payments.

Trump's proposal is somewhat similar to Obama's student loan repayment plan. But a recent study found that the current administration's plan could cost the government twice as much as anticipated, which could put the future of the policy at risk.",2016-12-09,millennials don't think a trump presidency will affect their wallets,Millennials don't think a Trump presidency will affect their wallets,"['do', 'think', 'will', 'affect']",['their wallets'],"['millennials', 'think', 'presidency']",1.0
Will we still target millennials when they are 75 or will we instead focus on the next generation of freshly minted grown-ups?,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-darroch/will-we-still-target-mill_b_9330502.html,"Jenny Darroch Marketing strategy expert, Drucker School of Management

So asked a recent client of mine when we were (yet again) talking about how to reach millennials.

When marketers talk about reaching millennials, they are talking about reaching people born between 1982 and 2000. In the USA, this group represents more than one-quarter of the population (or 83.1 million) and is larger than the baby boomer group of 75.4 million . Collectively, millennials in the USA spend $200 billion each year.

Our fascination with millennials is not so much with... well, millennials, but with what they represent. At a quarter of the population, this group is certainly too large to ignore. Since millennials currently represent those aged 14-32, I suggest we split the group in two:

1. Younger millennials (ages 14-24) - I will call this group ""The Apprentices""

o Most of this group is still pursuing an education. Those aged 14-18 are probably in high school and 75% of those aged 18 - 24 are in college.

o Because this group is mostly still in school, the group is likely to rely on other sources of funds such as parents and student loans. Younger millennials are also likely to work full or part time but will not earn a lot of money.

o Younger millennials buy products for themselves. This group will use brands to reveal their own identity.

o This group also pays attention to what their parents buy and so brand preferences for later purchase decisions will also be formed. This is why I call them Apprentices.

2. Older millennials (ages 25-32) - I will call this group ""The Freshly Minted Grown Ups"":

o By the time this group has reached 25, half of the 75% who entered college will have graduated. Many will have had their first child - the average age for first time mothers is 26 but this rises to 30 for college-educated women ; married (average age 27 for women and 29 for men (although 49% of all those aged 25-34 have never married ). Older millennials haven't quite purchased their own home as the average age of a first time homebuyer is 33 .

o The data gets a bit patchy here - median incomes for those with a college education is $45,500 (vs. $28,000 - $30,000 without a college education); and 1/3 of college graduates return to live at home. But a defining characteristic is that older millennials strive for financial independence from their parents.

o Older millennials make their own brand choices across a wide range of product categories from products for themselves (fashion and accessories, health and beauty, entertainment, etc.), to products with others (weddings, setting up a home), to products for others (babies and partners). This is why I refer to this group as the freshly minted grown ups - they have finally graduated to adulthood.

Therefore, the first reason to pay attention to millennials, especially older millennials, is that this group is interacting with a large number of product categories from cars to financial services to furniture and appliances to wedding planning to baby items to entertainment to clothing and personal services. Older millennials are finally making their own brand choices - brand choices that are free from parental influence. The brands that help older millennials transition into contemporary adulthood will be the brands that older millennials likely stay loyal to for years to come. There are not that many other age groups that interact with so many product categories.

A second reason to pay attention to millennials is that they replace aging customers who need to be replaced if the organization intends on surviving.

A third reason to pay attention to millennials is that most Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) are not millennials themselves. Even if CMOs have children or nieces and nephews who are millennials, millennials can feel a bit mysterious. To understand millennials means to stay current with: (1) cultural and social trends, (2) brand messages that matter to millennials, (3) brands that celebrate the fact that millennials are making an independent choice and not choosing a brand because their parents purchased the brand, and (4) technology and how this changes the customer experience and provides new ways to engage with and reach customers.

Will we still target millennials when they are 75? YES if we are interested in products for seniors but NO if we are interested in a group of consumers who are forming lasting relationships with brands from organizations that want to remain contemporary to our freshly minted grown ups. Maybe we should stop referring to the 25-32s as millennials and instead call them marketers' butterflies - a group of engaged and active consumers who have finally emerged from the pupae that have protected them for so long.

Our next butterflies will be younger millennials - i.e., our current apprentices, and this group will followed by Generation Z. My point: a sustainable organization needs to pay attention to a pipeline of consumers, what matters to them, and how to connect with them.",2016-02-29,will we still target millennials when they are 75 or will we instead focus on the next generation of freshly minted grown-ups?,Will We Still Target Millennials When They Are 75 or Will We Instead Focus on the Next Generation of Freshly Minted Grown-ups?,"['Will', 'Target', 'Are', 'Will', 'Focus']","['the Next Generation', 'Freshly Minted Grown-ups']","['will', 'we', 'they', 'are', 'we', 'focus']",0.0

Prenuptial agreements are on the rise for B.C.'s younger newlyweds, says family lawyer Georgialee Lang.

According to a recent survey from the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, prenuptial agreements are rising for newlyweds aged 18 to 35 -- and Lang says the shift is noticeably taking place in B.C.

""We're seeing [prenuptial agreements] more notably with millennials -- and there's a whole range of reasons as to why that's happening,"" she told host Gloria Macarenko on CBC's B.C. Almanac.

Lang says that trend is taking place primarily because millennials are waiting until they're in their 30s to get hitched, unlike previous generations -- and that millennials tend to enter marriages with a lot more to lose.

""People in their early 30s have had an opportunity to acquire assets -- and they're aware of that,"" she said.

Maple Ridge's Misty McGill falls into that category. She bought her first apartment in her mid-20s and spent the next decade working tirelessly to pay it off.

""It took a lot of Kraft-Dinner eating just to make sure the mortgage payments were made,"" she said, laughing.

McGill​ and her partner are both in their 30s and have started talking about the possibility of getting married.

She admits there's nothing romantic about a prenuptial agreement but thinks it's important that her years worth of hard work not get lost in the unfortunate event of a divorce or separation.

""It's just a matter of being responsible and forward thinking. It's better to do it now when everyone's on good terms than when things could be ugly,"" she said.

While McGill hopes to eventually take the plunge into holy matrimony, more than 21,000 British Columbians have already been married in 2016. And with a national divorce rate of 40 per cent (according to the latest data from Statistics Canada), an estimated 8,400 of them could end up divorced.

Lang says that while prenuptial agreements can be helpful, what's most important is to have open conversations about what assets each partner wants to have protected given the likelihood of separation.

""The more you talk, the better the communication is, the more these agreements will work out.""

Tim tebow encourages millennials to find identity in christ in social media age (exclusive interview),http://www.gospelherald.com/articles/71930/20190213/tim-tebow-encourages-millennials-find-identity-christ-social-media-age.htm,"But to run the race of life in a God-glorifying way, young people need to have a proper understanding of identity, success, and significance, Tebow explained.

""The world is going to tell you that it's about your social media followers. It's going to tell you it's about how popular you are. It's going to tell you it's about how many likes you get when you post something. And I'm going to tell you that that truly doesn't matter,"" he said. ""What matters is that there's a God that desperately loves you and He wants to know you and there is a purpose and a reason for you being here.""

He referenced Ephesians 2:10, which states: ""For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.""

""You are His poem. You're His masterpiece. He loves you and He has a great plan for your life,"" Tebow emphasized. ""You matter. Before you were ever born, He wrote that poem about your life for good works for you to accomplish. And I want to encourage people that there is something special out there for them, that the God of this universe loves them so much that He has something special in store for them.""

""So keep looking to Him, the author and perfecter of our faith,"" he concluded. ""That's how we can keep our eyes focused on running the right race.""

Tebow, alongside his brother Robby, are executive producers of the upcoming film ""Run the Race."" Coming to theaters Feb. 22, the film shows what's possible when you run to -- instead of from -- the overwhelming love of God.

""Run the Race"" tells the story of Zach and David Truett, two brothers who, despite their differences, learn from one another and support each other as their individual paths to God unfold.

Zach, an All-State athlete, finds his identity on the football field as he battles his own struggles stemming from the death of his mother and his father's abandonment and continued alcoholism. In turn, David works long hours at the local grocery store to provide for himself and his brother.

When Zach's dreams of earning a college scholarship are dashed due to a devastating injury, David laces up his track cleats to salvage their future. Meanwhile, Zach grows close to Ginger, a nurse at the hospital. But when yet another tragedy strikes, the boys must rely on one another and decide if the Christian faith they were taught as children is real.

Running the race of life, Tebow said, means there's a finish line -- but the goal isn't winning or taking first place. Rather, it means living a life of significance -- and that's defined by God.

""'Making it' changes when you know God,"" he said. ""Knowing God means okay, it's not just about what the world says. It's not just about material things. It's not everything I thought it was. Now it changes to more purpose and meaning and significance.""

The 31-year-old athlete, who recently hosted his foundation's annual ""Night to Shine"" program celebrating people with special needs, told GH that one way he strives to find significance in life is by helping those in need.

He shared how, when he was 15 years old, he met a young boy from the Philippines who was born with a congenital knee deformity.

""It changed my life forever because he was shunned and everyone looked at him as cursed and insignificant, so he couldn't be part of the village,"" he recounted. ""And I knew at that moment leaving that village after praying with that young boy to put his faith in Jesus, that what I was called to do for the rest of my life was to fight for people that can't fight for themselves.""

Tebow, who has played in both the NFL and MLB, told GH that he hopes the film encourages young people to ""not run away from God, but run to God because He loves them like crazy.""

""It might feel sometimes like you're alone and it might feel sometimes like the world is really hard,"" he acknowledged. ""But there is a God that loves you so much and He wants to know you and He wants to have a personal, intimate relationship with you.""

""Run the Race"" also stars Mykelti Williamson (FENCES, FORREST GUMP), Frances Fisher (TITANIC, UNFORGIVEN), Tanner Stine (NCIS), Evan Hofer (Kickin' It), and Kelsey Reinhardt (Transparent).

Millennials are now largest living generation in america,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/millennials-largest-living-generation-america-article-1.2614745,"Millennials now officially rule America -- at least, according to census data.

Those narcissistic, phone-obsessed, Snapchattin'-and-hashtaggin' whippersnappers are now the largest living generation in America, outnumbering their Baby Boomer and Generation X elders, according to a report released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center.

The report, based on new U.S. Census Bureau data, says millennials -- Americans ages 18 to 34 -- now number 75.4 million. That puts them ahead of baby boomers (ages 51 to 69), at 74.9 million, and Generation X (ages 35 to 50), at about 66 million.

The report says two major factors allowed millennials to now reign supreme: Immigration and death. Millennial immigrants have moved into America at a higher rate than immigrants from the previous two generations, according to the report.

At the same time, baby boomers aren't getting any younger. By the middle of the 20th century, America will have an estimated 16.6 million baby boomers left alive, the report says.

The millennial rise is projected to continue through 2036, when the generation's population will peak at 81.1 million, the report says. After that, the population will start leveling off as death takes its course.

There have been countless articles blaming millennials for being tech-obsessed and self-entitled, and countless more defending the generation from these stereotypes.

However, not all stereotypes about the generation are untrue.

Like in any generational shift, there are distinguishing features that set millennials apart. Millennials waste money -- like every other generation does. The question is, how are they wasting money differently than their forebears?

These are some of the most common ways millennials waste their money:

Millennials tend to prefer experiences over ownership, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Spending money on experiences rather than tangible items gives you better memories and teaches you more lessons. But when it comes to building wealth and living financially , focusing exclusively on experiences can be problematic. Experiences are temporary, whereas tangible objects tend to be semi-permanent.

Buying a home, for example, helps you build equity, and gives you an asset that will likely appreciate in value over several years. Renting, which millennials prefer, builds no equity whatsoever.

Spending too much money on things like concerts and special events, too, can quickly drain your entertainment budget.

Millennials are the ""grab and go"" generation, with 29% of millennials claiming to purchase food ""on the go"" very often -- compared to 19% of the broader population.

Rather than buying inexpensive groceries and cooking their own meals, millennials have no problem stopping at a local fast food restaurant, or even a gas station, for some quick, ready-to-eat food. Establishments like these charge a premium for the extra time and effort necessary to provide food this way.

The millennial generation gets a bad reputation for being both impulsive and impatient, and in some ways, the stereotype turns out to be true. One 2015 study found that 30% of millennials view same-day delivery as important -- that compares to 19% for Gen X shoppers, 13% of baby boomers and 5% of seniors.

In some cases, this may be necessary -- for example, if you need a book for a college course or a replacement part for your vehicle, next-day shipping may be well worth the cost. However, most of the time, planning ahead and waiting a few extra days for your shipment can save you significant money.

In a self-reported survey, millennials described their most common money wasters as going out to eat and losing expired food -- both of which can fall under the ""food"" category above.

The next most common money waster was drinking alcohol, with over 27% of millennials claiming to spend too much money here (compared to 22% of Gen Xers and 13% of baby boomers).

This may be related to ' tendency to invest in experiences rather than tangible goods, as alcohol is an exhaustible resource, and usually leads to a (temporarily) good time.

There's no harm in investing conservatively. A well-balanced portfolio of different investment assets, over the course of a few decades, can still leave you well-equipped to retire comfortably.

However, millennials are altogether avoiding the stock market -- only one in three is currently investing in stocks.

The stock market historically has been one of the best and most reliable ways to build wealth, so ignoring that opportunity could be quite costly. Millennials are also young, and younger people -- regardless of their generation -- have the luxury of investing more aggressively. Since they have more time to recover from potential downturns, it's wise for them to make riskier investments while they have the chance.

The irony here is that millennial investors believe that they're saving themselves money -- after witnessing the economic recession of 2008, they're wary of potential fluctuations in the stock market, and would rather not take the gamble.

If you're in the millennial generation, this list should help you understand some of the ways you and/or your peers are wasting money. No one has a perfect financial record, and of course, you're allowed to occasionally indulge yourself.

But the better control you have over your financial habits, the better future you can create for yourself.",2017-06-23,the 5 biggest ways millennials waste money,The 5 biggest ways millennials waste money,['waste'],['money'],"['millennials', 'waste']",1.0
Forget catering to millennials at work  --  everyone wants the same things,http://www.businessinsider.com/forget-catering-to-millennials-at-work-everyone-wants-the-same-things-2017-8,"A simple Google search for ""What do Millennials want at work?"" serves up around 15 million results.

Needless to say, there's no shortage of advice on (or critiques of) Generation Y and the many ways organizations should cater to their perceived needs. They demand opportunities to learn and grow at a company, but they're quick to job hop every few years.

They want to work for a company with purpose, but they need recognition, too. They seek mentorship and community at work, but desire autonomy at the same time.

For employers, appeasing all of these Millennial expectations in addition to meeting the rest of their multigenerational workforce's needs is a strain at best and impossible at worst.

But here's the catch: What Millennials want out of work is actually not so different than previous generations.

They share a basic human desire that has been shaped by the technology they grew up around -- and this tech is influencing Generation X and Baby Boomers, too.

There are multiple theories on human behavior that echo the Millennial musings we so often hear today. Needs often attributed to Millennials, such as a search for purpose at work, are no strangers to the generations that came before.

Consider Viktor Frankl's 1946 psychological memoir, Man's Search for Meaning, in which he proposed that finding meaning in life helped Auschwitz prisoners survive, one of them being purposeful work. In 2000, professors Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan published a breakthrough paper on a term they coined ""self-determination theory,"" suggesting that people (not just Millennials) are motivated by personal fulfillment, typically through three channels: autonomy, connectedness and learning.

What's more, many of the popular observations about Millennials have been made about other generations as young adults. In 1968, LIFE Magazine ran a cover story on the ""Generation Gap,"" describing ""privileged, narcissistic, entitled, spoiled, lazy"" young people -- young Baby Boomers, that is. TIME ran a similar story on young Gen Xers in 1990, calling them ""lazy, entitled, selfish, shallow, unambitious shoe-gazers ... [who] have trouble making decisions. They would rather hike in the Himalayas than climb a corporate ladder.""

So, what gives? Perhaps it's not that Millennials are inherently different from earlier generations, but that innovation has enabled a progressive mental shift around work. Over the past three generations, the world has gotten ""smaller,"" not to mention faster. It's never been easier to change your career or pursue a passion -- and it's never been more acceptable either.

Young Gen Xers may have wanted to hike the Himalayas, but Millennials are able to turn their Himalayan adventures into profitable travel blogs and global non-profits. And while Millennials are the most well-versed in this new world of work, company leaders should recognize that today's norms continue to influence every generation's career expectations.

It's not just Millennials striking out on their own or following a passion. In 2015, the Kauffman Foundation found that Baby Boomers were twice as likely to launch a new business this year as Millennials. And across generations, employees are willing to make life-altering decisions to find fulfillment in their careers. In fact, Cornerstone's Career Trends Report found that 81 percent of Baby Boomers, 91 percent of Gen Xers and 94 percent of Millennials would consider a lateral career move with no financial incentive.

Instead of worrying about Millennials, organizations should meet the needs of a multigenerational workforce in whole by keeping purpose and mobility top of mind. Company leaders can foster an organizational climate conducive to individual growth through practices that make employees feel heard and supported -- regardless of title or tenure -- such as:

As the world of work continues to transform, the expectations, aspirations and behaviors of every generation will transform. Millennials may be leading the charge, but they're not alone -- regardless of age, the best employees are seeking organizations that can fulfill both their potential and their purpose.",2017-08-16,forget catering to millennials at work  --  everyone wants the same things,Forget catering to millennials at work  --  everyone wants the same things,"['Forget', 'wants']","['millennials', 'work', 'the same things']","['everyone', 'wants']",0.0
"Millennials, downtown wellness center wants to be your 'medical home'",http://tucson.com/news/local/millennials-downtown-wellness-center-wants-to-be-your-medical-home/article_97df130f-8f47-5e0d-8181-f366547d26c5.html,"With residential construction ramping up in downtown Tucson, two local nonprofits have joined forces to open what they say those new city dwellers need -- a modern integrated health center.

HealthOn Broadway is set to open in January in leased space on the first floor of 1 W. Broadway Blvd. -- a six-story building formally called One West on the southwest corner of Broadway and Stone, along the streetcar line.

The third to sixth floors of the building will be apartments and the second floor will be parking for residents, said Crystal McGuire-Moore of Presidio Management. McGuire-Mooreis the designated broker for One West, which is being built by Caylor Design & Construction and designed by BWS Architects.

The health center, which will be staffed to accommodate up to 7,000 patient visits per year, is be a collaboration between Tucson Medical Center and El Rio Community Health Center, whose leaders have formed a joint venture called HealthOn Tucson. The joint venture will lease the health center space from One West Broadway LLC, a local investment group.

HealthOn Broadway leaders say they are responding to existing and future downtown trends -- more city dwellers, plus a growing group of millennials who work downtown and often don't have a primary-care doctor.

Tucson Medical Center is the area's largest and only remaining locally owned community hospital. El Rio is Southern Arizona's largest community health center, with clinics across town.

The two have partnered since 2012 in Arizona Connected Care, an Accountable Care Organization -- a group of partners giving coordinated care to Medicare patients as a way of keeping them out of the hospital and avoiding the duplication of services. HealthOn Tucson is an outgrowth of that partnership.

Leaders of both organizations say they share an intrigue in how to engage the community around healthcare.

""El Rio and TMC and other health providers are very cognizant that the residential base is growing and it's a very diverse base with a lot of diverse needs,"" said Michael Keith, CEO of the Downtown Tucson Partnership.

""It's just another piece in this successful puzzle that's being assembled...You are looking at a very different downtown in three years. We're tracking about 22 projects right now in various stages.""

Most of those projects are residential. It only makes sense that services and amenities will follow the demographics, Keith said.

El Rio Community Health Center already has a strong presence downtown. It has a clinic at 839 W. Congress west of Interstate 10, also on the streetcar line, and recently relocated its administrative headquarters to the historic downtown Manning House, 450 W. Paseo Redondo.

But El Rio CEO Nancy Johnson says HealthOn Broadway will be different from its other sites because it's an entirely new model.

""We're seeing this space as being more creative and not really medically modeled,"" Johnson said. ""There will be a lot of rooms in there that we are calling dialogue talking rooms around health coaching and helping people improve their health and stay as healthy as possible.""

An example would be a ""better backs"" class based on the number of people they've spoken with battling back strain issues, she said.

""I think it's the model for where we are today and where we're going to go,"" Tucson Medical Center CEO Judy Rich said.

Millennial health

The new HealthOn Broadway facility will offer primary care during off-hours and Saturdays (7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays), and will encourage patients to make it their ""medical home"" -- the place they go to get primary care, project officials say. But if downtown workers have another medical home, they are welcome to get care at the new center too, officials said.

The 8,211-square-foot center also will offer lectures, health education and wellness coaching and will take advantage of technology, offering established patients appointmentsby Smartphone or desktop computer, self check-in, and tools to take their own vital signs.

""It's leveraging wonderful new technology and equipment and it's hard to find that in this community right now,"" said Rich said.

Millennials, roughly ages 18-35, tend to have few health problems. Rich and Johnson say that's an opportunity for a health center -- keeping them healthy, helping them with long-term health and providing a place to get treated for the occasional acute illness.

""It's very important, healthy or not, for everyone to have a primary care provider or primary care home,"" Johnson said. ""Just because you are healthy doesn't mean you shouldn't have a relationship with a healthcare system.""

At the moment there's no plan for an on-site pharmacy, though some commonly used prescription will be on hand. Rather, patients can use the pharmacy at El Rio's West Congress Street location, which delivers.

In addition to traditional clinical visits, blood draws and X-rays, patients can expect non-traditional treatments, too. Yoga, tai chi and other wellness and fitness activities will be offered, similar to what Tucson Medical Center offers at its two-year-old, north-side wellness center The Core, at the La Encantada shopping mall.

HealthOn Broadway also has a nutrition partner downtown with the demo kitchen at chef Janos Wilder's Carriage House event space at 125 S. Arizona Ave. That gives both entities an opportunity to reach the downtown market through healthy eating activities, like lunch and learn classes.

Moving beyond acute care

Changes in the healthcare industry have more non-profit health systems entering businesses where hospitals have not traditionally operated, a May 2016 Moody's Investors Service report says.

The new ventures let hospitals ""gain a foothold and expertise in new, but complimentary businesses,"" the report says.

HealthOn Broadway also gives Tucson Medical Center a new vehicle to attract patients when they do need a hospital. The local hospital market is increasingly competitive, dominated by large health systems headquartered outside of Tucson.

Tucson Medical Center still dominates in market share for individual hospitals, but Phoenix-based Banner health has publicly stated it wants a bigger piece of the pie.

The company entered the Tucson market last year when it acquired Banner - University Medical Center Tucson and Banner - University Medical Center South. It is investing a half billion dollars locally, building a new hospital and clinical operations.

Downtown workers

The city and county have long wanted health services nearby where employees could walk during the day, Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild said.

An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people work downtown.

Caterpillar Inc. in May announced it would bring more than 600 jobs to downtown Tucson over five years with employees in executive management, engineering, product development and support positions.

Other companies that have added employees to the downtown area include El Rio, Tucson Electric Power and Madden Media.

Because the residential projects being built downtown are for a range of incomes, with some targeted at seniors, HealthOn Tucson leaders say they are prepared to serve a varied population.

HealthOn Broadway's payment structure will work the same way El Rio Community Health Center handles patients, accepting self-pay, any kind of major insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid, which in Arizona is called AHCCCS, or the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. Anyone without insurance pays on a sliding fee scale.

Since the only parking lot at One West will be for residents, there's no designated parking lot for patients.

""We imagine a lot of our patients will be in walking distance of the center,"" El Rio CEO Johnson said.

One West

The top three stories of the One West building above HealthOn Broadway will be rental apartments with expansive views of A Mountain, St. Augustine Cathedral and the downtown area. Half of the units have already been reserved with minimal marketing.

The one-, two- and three-bedroom units range from 832 to 1,604 square feet. Monthly rents start at $1,521 and go up to $3,297. There's also a locked area for bicycles, and a rooftop deck with a pet relief area.

The rental-only building has the same ownership as the One East, located at 1 E. Broadway on the northeast corner of Broadway and Stone.

The first residents of One East moved in during December of 2013 and the building has been full ever since, McGuire-Moore said.

""We had this really strong waiting list of people wanting to live the urban lifestyle but supply was lacking,"" she said. So One East's owners bought the site for One West in April 2015.

Construction, with an estimated cost of $13 million to $14 million, began in late 2015. The first residents are expected to move in during November, before the health center opens.

The people wanting such units typically come from the suburbs and are downsizing from large homes, she said.

""When talking with our existing and future residents the theme is consistent -- how liberating it is to get rid of stuff, have less, do more,"" McGuire-Moore said.

From derelict to hip

Now that HealthOn Broadway is set to move downtown, the question is what services and amenities will follow.

""When your downtown was as derelict as ours was, none of the services are generally in place, Tucson Downtown Partnership's Keith said. They tend to follow the changes in population.""

A wide range of opinions exist on the types of amenities needed, Keith said.

""You hear drug store mentioned often, you hear specialty retail mentioned a lot,"" he said. ""You have another group of people who say what we need to see down here is national retailers, because that will signal that we've truly turned the corner.

""People talk about everything from Nordstrom's and Anthropologie, or a second Apple Store. Another one you hear is Trader Joe's.""

He predicts change will be constant over the next few years.

""Cities like ours are late to the redevelopment game,"" he said. ""But when it happens, it happens very quickly.""",2016-10-01,"millennials, downtown wellness center wants to be your 'medical home'","Millennials, downtown wellness center wants to be your 'medical home'","['wants', 'be']",[],"['millennials', 'wants']",1.0

4 lessons about how millennials spend money from mtv's new reality competition show,http://www.businessinsider.com/mtv-stranded-with-a-million-dollars-millennials-money-2017-3,"The cast of ""Stranded with a Million Dollars.""MTV

MTV's new show, ""Stranded with a Million Dollars,"" serves up a twist on the reality survival show.

On the new series, which airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m., 10 millennials from diverse backgrounds accept the challenge of living on the island of Taveuni, Fiji. But they're also given a total of $1 million to spend on a variety of food, tools, and luxuries at outrageous prices. In the end, those who are able to last for 40 days will get to divide whatever's left of the million-dollar bounty.

With its million-dollar twist and the tough living conditions, viewers get an ample look at the cast members' attitudes toward money.

""I was guilty of the preconceived notion that millennials are lazy and don't understand the value of money,"" ""Stranded"" creator Kevin Lee recently told Business Insider. ""And what happened during the 40 days that we were filming in the woods is that I learned that was wrong. That notion was wrong.""

Reactions to the harsh environment and the financial windfall are captured by the show's use of flying drones and automatic cameras.

""On any given day, there's approximately 30 cameras in play that don't have humans holding them,"" Lee said. ""That made all the difference in the world... I think they headed toward more extreme behavior because they didn't feel that they were being judged by the human holding the camera. When there's just a robot camera, they don't care what the robot thinks.""",2017-03-07,4 lessons about how millennials spend money from mtv's new reality competition show,4 lessons about how millennials spend money from MTV's new reality competition show,['spend'],"['money', ""MTV's new reality competition show""]","['lessons', 'millennials']",1.0
What's at the heart of millennials' preference for socialism?,http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/creech/181130,"By Rev. Mark H. Creech

A little more than 40% of millennials today say they prefer socialism. To me, this is the most troubling indicator of a dark future for America if it's not turned around.

What would make this younger generation unimpressed with freedom or the great costs paid by so many brave souls to secure it? They must not want freedom or appreciate it. They would rather trade it for a socialistic dream and the empty promises of a man-made utopia, something which has always historically ended in a nightmare and dystopia for dozens of countries.

Although I would not venture to portray myself as a sage, I'm confident that I know what's at the heart of this foolishness. It is because, generally speaking, millennials and their parents possess little or no understanding of the intense spiritual nature of freedom.

Liberty wasn't born out of the United States Congress but from the heart of God. It is an inalienable right - a God-given right - a right which belongs to all men everywhere and in every age. The government doesn't grant inalienable rights. Its task is to protect them. No person, no group, no government, is authorized by our Creator God to infringe upon what is the absolute inherent privileges of being made in the image of God or might interfere with one's duty to God. When we try to separate liberty from the spiritual, when we base it in human definitions and objectives alone, freedom is corrupted, counterfeited, and dies.

The renowned Methodist minister, the late J. Wallace Hamilton, explained the fantastic spiritual nature of liberty by suggesting a paraphrase of Jesus' words, ""Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God"" (Mt. 4:4). Hamilton paraphrased the text to read, ""Man does not live by freedom alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God,"" which is to say that freedom is not an end in itself.

Hamilton said, ""If men are disillusioned about freedom, it is not freedom that has failed us but false freedom, freedom divorced from the great words of God...Every attempt to find freedom at the expense of other compelling ideals leads to famine, futility, and disillusionment.""

Charles Spurgeon also spoke along these same lines and admonished: ""We do well to look upon the word of the Lord [The Bible] as though it were newly spoken into our ear; for in very truth it is not decayed by years, but is as forcible and sure as though newly uttered. Precepts are prized when it is seen that they come forth from the lips of our Father who is in heaven. The same lips which spoke us into existence have spoken the law by which we govern that existence. Whence could a law so sweetly proceed as from the mouth of our covenant God? Well may we prize beyond all price that which comes from such a source.""

It's somewhat another subject. But if pastors and the churches they lead are unwilling to take up politics, if they are unwilling to faithfully teach the multitudes concerning the way civil liberty and the Christian reality of spiritual liberty interlock, liberty cannot be preserved. I will say it again, and without apology, freedom cannot survive because it is intensely divine in nature.

Like Hamilton, I suggest a paraphrase of my own. Let's take the words of the apostle Paul in Romans 10:14 about salvation: ""How shall they call on the Lord if they haven't believed? How shall they believe in Him, or experience the liberty He gives, or comprehend the true meaning and foundation of freedom if they haven't heard? And how shall they hear these things without a preacher?""

King David, whom the Scripture references as a prophet, priest, and king, says in Psalm 119: ""Do not snatch the word of truth from my mouth for I have put my hope in your laws. I will always obey your law, forever and ever. I will walk about in freedom, for I have sought out your precepts. I will speak of your statutes before kings and will not be put to shame, for I delight in your commandments because I love them"" (vs. 43-47)

David knew the tendency of leaders to sacrifice the truth of their faith to pomp, statecraft, and the political correctness of the day; but he says that he would not have the word of truth snatched from his mouth. Instead, he would sanctify politics, and make those who were commissioned to govern know who really runs the world.

David might have thought it more prudent not to touch upon religion and politics in the same breath, especially in the presence of people from another faith. He might have been tempted to rationalize that his life and conduct should be enough. But he concludes, ""I will speak,"" for the source of freedom and hope is only in the Lord and his statutes. This message is most needful for kings and those that administer the affairs of state. There is no sense in fearing the messenger might be shamed when the dishonor is for the one who rejects the word of the Lord.

What a great vacuum silent preachers have created that now the socialists would fill, nevertheless, socialists choose to trade the rights given by a gracious and benevolent Heavenly Father for the mass mind and the mass will. Socialism gives away one's birthright for a mess of pottage. It is a poor trade - a monumentally poor trade - one that inevitably leads to bondage and tyranny.

There is no slavery or oppression, however, in sanctity - only liberty. For Christ's sake fellow believers, if you truly know the Savior, you should know this is true. Speak up!

Are millennials living on avocados - and beyond their means?,http://www.newstalk.com/Are-millennials-living-on-avocados--and-beyond-their-means,"""When I was trying to buy my first home, I wasn't buying smashed avocado for $19 and four coffees at $4 each.""

So says 35-year-old property tycoon Tim Gurner - according to the millionaire, millennials are facing into the future never owning their own home.

""We are coming into a new reality where ... a lot of people won't own a house in their lifetime. That is just the reality,"" he told 60 Minutes.

But is avocado toast the real reason why so many are struggling to afford mortgages?

""I came out of college in 2007, just as everything was about to go bust, and spent most of twenties earning less than €25,000 in cities around the world,"" Sinead O'Carroll, Head of News at The Journal told The Pat Kenny Show.

""I'm not married. As a single person, I can't go in and get a mortgage.""

Sunday Times columnist Brenda Power, however, said Gurner has a point when it comes to millennial attitudes towards savings.

""As a parent of millennials, I see no real connection between the idea of saving and acquiring something, and I think that's the fault of my generation,"" she said.

""However, I think it's much more complex than simply 'stop eating avocado on toast and you'll have a house in five years'. I can't blame young people today for despairing.

""I was able to buy a house at 26 because there was simply nothing else to spend money on [...] I remember being shown a house on Cork Street [in Dublin] for £3,000.""

O'Carroll cited the abundance of choice available to them as one of the ""enviable"" differences between the generations.

""I think the idea that millenials waste their money on avocado toast comes from the idea that we had stagnated wages for a long time and this is the first time we've had disposable income with no access to the housing market.""

However, she said one thing her generation doesn't have a choice on concerns housing ownership.

""I spoke to a TD recently and his still belief was that everybody in Ireland wanted to own a home. That's not everyone's desire. I would personally like to have security in a decent rental.

""I think the idea of generations above looking at the generation below them and thinking, 'they're not working as hard' [...] I think my generation will probably do that to the ones below us.

""I had a job the entire way through college. If I went on any extravagant trips, I was staying in hostels and I was paying for them.""

Power, meanwhile, said the focus for young people has moved to experiences and not tangible things, because now, there are more to be had.

""There's a lack of any sense of delayed gratification ever. If you wanted to see the second episode of a television series, you waited until next week. If you wanted Ed Sheeran's new record, you saved up for the 45, you didn't just click on Spotify.""",2017-05-17,are millennials living on avocados - and beyond their means?,Are millennials living on avocados - and beyond their means?,"['Are', 'living']","['avocados', 'their means']",['are'],0.0
Auto enrolled 401(k)s key for millennials,http://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Auto-enrolled-401-k-s-key-for-millennials-6588711.php,"Much has been made about the effect that the 2007-09 bear market has had on the investing habits of today's 20-somethings. The theory goes that coming of age during a severe market downturn will put you off stocks, and the risks they entail, for good.

But a recent study by the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research finds that technology can help us overcome past experiences.

According to the report, the median allocation that millennials had in stocks in 2003 was 82 percent. In 2013, the allocation actually increased to 89 percent.

Millennials are defined as those 18 to 34. Vanguard's study was based on 393 employer-sponsored retirement plans that were available in 2003 and 2013, and encompasses as many as 1 million plan-eligible employees.

So what happened? According to Vanguard, the answer is automation.

In 2003, less than 1 percent of the plans in Vanguard's study offered automatic enrollment, a feature in which employees are automatically enrolled in their workplace retirement plan, no signing up required.

A decade later, the figure had jumped to 40 percent.

On top of that, more young people are now taking advantage of all-in-one funds, like target-date funds, that hold a balance of stocks, bonds and other investments.

As the author of the Vanguard study, Jean Young, noted in the report, ""millennials are more risk-averse than both Gen Xers and late boomers."" But, she added, ""The data suggest that automatic enrollment and the rise of target-date funds have played substantial roles in changing saving and investment behavior.""

What if you're automatically enrolled in your employer's retirement plan? Here's what you can expect.

The Vanguard study found that, typically, the default contribution rate for those who are automatically enrolled in a workplace retirement plan is 3 percent.

While that's better than not participating at all in your 401(k), it's a long way from the 10 percent or more that most financial advisers suggest putting away for retirement each year.

The good news is that the majority of 401(k)s with auto enrollment also have an auto-increase feature for contributions. In fact, according to Vanguard, 70 percent of auto-enroll plans automatically raise workers' contribution rates annually.

Keep in mind, too, that by starting to save early in your 401(k) you get to take advantage of any matching contributions from your employer.

As such, in 2013, millennials who had automatically been enrolled in their company retirement plan were saving an average of 7.6 percent of their annual salary when the employer match was included.

Auto enrollment not only helps you get started saving for retirement, it can also lead you to smart investment choices.

In many auto enrollment plans, target-date funds, which hold a balance of stocks, bonds and other investments that are appropriate for your age, are the default investment option.

For 20-somethings, a target-date fund will invest mostly in stocks, which are riskier than cash and bonds but usually produce higher returns over long periods of time -- key for young savers trying to build a nest egg.

So in 2013, the median allocation to stocks among millennials who had been automatically enrolled in their 401(k) was 89 percent. In 2003, the median allocation, whether a young person was auto-enrolled or not, was 82 percent.

And thanks to target-date funds, fewer young people now have portfolios with zero or 100 percent stocks, what Vanguard calls ""extreme"" portfolios.

In 2003, 42 percent of millennials had extreme portfolios. A decade later, the percentage had dropped to just 3 percent for those auto-enrolled.",2015-10-24,auto enrolled 401(k)s key for millennials,Auto enrolled 401(k)s key for millennials,['enrolled'],"['401(k)s key', 'millennials']","['auto', 'enrolled']",0.0
Self-taught financial advisers keep it real with millennials about money,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/self-taught-financial-advisers-keep-it-real-about-money-management-n817326,"Financial illiteracy and financial insecurity are two common issues facing people of color today.

Julien and Kiersten Mitchell Saunders did not realize how common this problem was until they started considering their futures and what it would take to achieve their financial goals. In the process, they discovered a generation of older millennials sharing the life lessons they learned with others.

Following the birth of their first child, the Saunders launched the website rich & Regular, a project as a means of assisting other young, African-Americans in understanding the importance of financial well-being and wealth. After being under development for two years, it is designed to be a web-based platform where the two share tips on eliminating debt and personal finance through personal experiences.

""We launched the site because we wanted to serve as a relatable example to regular people like us,"" Julien, 37, told NBC News. ""Often times, conversations about money are delivered in a way that feeds into the discomfort, shame, or fear people feel when talking about money.""

African-American household wealth, according to a recent report, is on a path to hit $0 by 2053. According to a 2016 U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey, nearly 24 percent of African-Americans live below the poverty level.

""A lot of this is the lingering effect of Jim Crow, domestic terrorism and institutional racism that has held us back from making progress at the same rate as other groups,"" Julien said. ""Black folk are far behind and in some cases, trending in the wrong direction concerning wage growth, unemployment, net worth, business ownership, graduation rates, homeownership etc.""

By the time Julien turns 40 in the next few years, he and Kirsten will have paid off the mortgage on their home. Not long after that, if things go as planned, they hope to retire completely from the corporate world.

Bryant Eubanks, 24, did not have anyone teaching him about personal finance, saving, and debt when he was younger. However, he did have examples. An Atlanta native and Morehouse College graduate, Eubanks, remembers waking up on early Saturday mornings and finding his uncle sitting at the kitchen table with his glasses, shuffling through papers with his calculator.

""I really didn't know what he was doing and never seemed to ask,"" Eubanks told NBC News. ""However, once I got older, I soon realized that he was budgeting and trying to find a way to manage the bills.""

The first in his immediate family to attend college, Eubanks graduated with a degree in business administration with a focus in management. He quickly realized that prior to college, he didn't know much about accounting, marketing, and formulating a business plan.

""This made me think that if I, valedictorian of my high school, wasn't knowledgeable of this information; I could only imagine how many other African-American boys and girls were unaware,"" he said.

Since graduation, Eubanks has continued his work as a trainer for Chick-fil-A as well as working part time as a teller for Wells Fargo. He does not want to become a prisoner to the same paycheck-to-paycheck cycle his loved ones experienced, so he created a spreadsheet listing variable and fixed expenses as a way to manage his finances. He also entered into the Executive MBA Program in the Terry School of Business at the University of Georgia and hopes to help others achieve their financial goals.

""I believe that my initial reason to major in business led me to a greater purpose of mentoring and educating the next generation of becoming more financially literate and business savvy,"" he said.

Marcus Garrett and Rich Jones, founders of the podcast Paychecks & Balances, are also helping younger people through their life experiences. They describe the podcast as a personal finance and career advice resource geared toward millennials interested in the intersection of work, money, and life.

""We started this podcast because we couldn't find a show that made conversations about work and money fun, informative and relatable to people that look like us,"" they told NBC News via email. ""We leverage our decade of professional experience as a Recruiter & HR Generalist and Certified Internal Auditor to provide entertaining insights and helpful tips on money management, professional growth, and other topics relevant to 20 and 30-somethings trying to get ahead.""

Trial and error, said Garrett and Jones, is how they learned much of the information they share on P&B. Their misfortunes are what they believe draw their listeners to the podcast.

""It's easy to feel like you're the only one messing up. We make it clear that's not the case,"" Jones said. ""We've each done some financially reckless stuff. But most importantly, we've learned from the mistakes.""

Saunders, Garrett, and Jones said this is why they are doing what they can to help others not fall into the same traps.

""Understanding these topics is very important. You can't be financially free if you don't understand the components,"" Garrett said. ""I've found that the millennials who are best with money often have a story that involves what they learned growing up. You don't know what you don't know and for many of us that's a lot.""",2017-12-11,self-taught financial advisers keep it real with millennials about money,Self-taught financial advisers keep it real with millennials about money,"['taught', 'keep']","['it', 'millennials', 'money']","['advisers', 'keep']",0.0

From All That to Saturday Night Live, he's been in the sketch comedy game since he was a kid, and now he's passing his expertise onto the next generation.

Thompson is teaming up with the digital media startup pocket.watch to launch a new children's series called pocket.watch Presents Skoogle, Variety reports. Geared toward kids ranging from 6-11 in age, the half-hour sketch comedy will spoof different apps, streaming services and the like. Kenan won't be starring, per se, but he'll lend his voice as a Siri-like virtual assistant who helps the kids out with their daily problems.

""I'm excited to once again team up with Albie Hecht and work alongside his great new team at pocket.watch to bring 'Skoogle' to life,"" he said in a statement ""Having been a part of sketch-comedy shows throughout my career, I'm thrilled to be able to introduce the show format that I love to an entirely new generation of kids.""

The project, which marks pocket.watch's first major production, will be shot in front of a live studio audience (with some parts prerecorded) and run about 10-13 episodes at first. Things are quickly coming together for the series and casting is expected to begin within the next few months.

Robbing pensioners to pay millennials - moneyweek,https://moneyweek.com/506140/robbing-pensioners-to-pay-millennials/,"Should we get rid of generous perks for pensioners to fund more support for cash-strapped young people? The House of Lords' committee on inter-generational fairness says policies like the triple-lock guarantee on state pensions, free TV licences and bus passes for pensioners, and even the winter fuel allowance may have had their day.

The argument is that as pensioners have seen their incomes rise more quickly than other groups over the past ten years, it now makes sense to prioritise younger generations. Savings could, for example, be ploughed into affordable housing.

So what would pensioners be missing out on? Well, analysis from the House of Commons Library in the run-up to the 2017 General Election, when Theresa May floated the idea of dumping the triple lock, suggested it would cost a pensioner with the full state pension £817 over the next five years.

That assumed pension benefits would simply be increased in line with inflation forecasts at the time, rather than the highest of inflation, earnings growth or 2.5%, as the triple lock promises. In addition, the winter fuel allowance is £200 per year for most pensioner households, while free TV licences are currently worth £154.50 a year.

Of course, the flipside to the these costs is the potential savings for taxpayers. The Institute for Fiscal Studies puts the net gain from abolishing the triple lock at around £4bn a year. Add in another £745m for free TV licences for the over-75s if they were scrapped - the BBC currently picks up this cost - plus the £2bn-£3bn cost of the winter fuel allowance, and significant sums on bus passes, and the savings begin to look very significant. It may come down to whose votes the government covets more.",2019-05-08,robbing pensioners to pay millennials - moneyweek,Robbing pensioners to pay millennials - MoneyWeek,"['Robbing', 'pay']",['pensioners'],['robbing'],0.0

Lead letter: social security must be reformed for millennials,http://jacksonville.com/opinion/letters-readers/2016-09-02/story/lead-letter-social-security-must-be-reformed-millennials,"Both parties are trying to ruin the futures of the 25 percent of Florida's population who are millennials.

I'm talking about what Democrats and Republicans want to do with Social Security.

While it's on the fast track to bankruptcy, the Democratic Party platform promises to expand Social Security benefits.

And while the Republican Party platform pays lip service to reforming Social Security, the GOP shows little interest in backing up its words with action.

Social Security will go broke in either case; the current estimate is 2034.

Social Security works by collecting money from current workers -- us -- to pay for benefits provided to today's retirees.

THIS IS A DIFFERENT TIME

This was all well and good in 1940 when there were 160 workers per retiree. Now there are not even three workers to each retiree.

That's reflected in Florida's workforce where in 2014 there were 7,953,600 people working compared to 4,223,274 Social Security beneficiaries -- a ratio of 1.88 to one.

That number is getting smaller, too.

Once Social Security runs out of money, the only options will be to reduce benefits drastically, cutting them down to three-quarters of what's currently distributed, or sock everyone in society -- not just the rich -- with higher taxes.

On that note, Democrats claim we can cover the costs simply by raising payroll taxes.

But that didn't work the first 20 times that Congress tried it.

Doing nothing, per the Republicans, is irresponsible.

Vowing to expand the program, per the Democrats, is delusional.

Millennials have the most at stake in this debate.

Talk to any millennial about what we want from benefits and in retirement.

You'll probably hear the word ""flexibility,"" which means mutual funds, IRAs, 401(k)s and all kinds of modern retirement programs provide exactly that -- and they are accessible with just a few clicks.

Instead of being a monolithic, one-size-fits-all program, Social Security should be redesigned to give us the flexibility to instantly tailor it to our individual needs.

This will never happen if millennials don't fight for it.

Right now, both Republicans and Democrats are letting a bad situation become even worse.

We should reject their empty promises and demand a better deal.

A deal that works for our generation rather than against us.",2016-09-02,lead letter: social security must be reformed for millennials,Lead Letter: Social Security must be reformed for millennials,"['must', 'be', 'reformed']",['millennials'],['reformed'],0.0
Attention millennials: kenan and kel are down for a good burger sequel,http://www.ncnewspress.com/ZZ/entertainment/20181210/attention-millennials-kenan-and-kel-are-down-for-good-burger-sequel?rssfeed=true,"After Hilary Duff dropped the news that Lizzie McGuire might be staging a comeback, Kenan Thompson is giving millennials another reason to cheer: a Good Burger sequel may be on the horizon!

During an appearance on Andy Cohen's late-night talk show Watch What Happens: Live, a fan asked Thompson whether or not a follow-up to the '90s classic would ever come to fruition after he and Kel Mitchell reprised their iconic film roles for a Tonight Show skit in 2015.

Discover your new favorite show: Watch This Now!

""We've been talking about it for a long time and we've had meetings about it. It's in the higher power's hands because we both said that we're down to do it,"" Thompson said of the potential sequel. So there's a chance we might be seeing Ed (Mitchell) and Dexter (Thompson) together again on the big screen? Count us in!

Thompson and Mitchell made a name for themselves as the iconic comedy duo of the '90s, first starring on the Nickelodeon sketch series All That before headlining their own series, Kenan & Kel, in 1996. After frequent collaborations, the pair drifted apart. They hadn't spoken for a long time until Nickelodeon super-producer Dan Schneider approached Thompson about reuniting for that Fallon sketch.

""He called me and like a friend of his was working on the Tonight Show and they had that idea to do the reunion. And he reached out to me and then I called Kel and we talked. We played phone tag for like three days but we finally talked and then were like, 'Yeah, might as well do it.' It was a nice 40-minute conversation. We hadn't spoken in a long time. It was nice to reconnect because it was like picking up right from where we left off, we worked so well,"" Thompson explained.

The two have kept in frequent contact since then, leaving no excuse for why it's taking so long to get this Good Burger sequel off the ground. They want it, we want it, everybody wants it! So, for the love of orange soda, someone make this happen soon. Pretty please?

Environmentalists to millennials: donald trump's climate policies are dangerous,http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-10-10/environmentalists-millennials-donald-trumps-climate-policies-are-dangerous,"Ramone Rushing, 32, knows this. He lives in Georgia, but recently loaded up his car and drove six hours northeast to Raleigh, North Carolina.

""It's campaign life,"" Rushing said. ""For campaign work, you really just need clothes and notepads. Couple of jeans, couple of pairs of shirts, and comfortable shoes, and here I am.""

Rushing signed on with NextGen Climate, an organization targeting young voters in seven key battleground states. The group was founded, and is largely funded, by billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist Tom Steyer.

The organization is just getting going in North Carolina. The words ""NextGen Climate"" are scribbled in marker on a piece of paper taped next to an office door. There are also stickers that say ""Stop Trump."" Donald Trump has said climate change is a hoax and b.s. And he's called for the elimination of regulators like the Environmental Protection Agency.

""Trump has already made statements that he will eliminate the EPA. Those sorts of ideas are things that are just not in line with what we stand for,"" Rushing said. ""The idea of a President Trump to me is baffling and terrifying.""

Trump has also said he'd ""cancel"" the Paris Climate Agreement, a landmark deal reached last year by 195 nations to mitigate greenhouse gases. (The agreement is set to take effect in early November.) In September, 375 members of the National Academy of Sciences, including 30 Nobel laureates, posted an open letter warning against Trump's positions.

Related: After quick action, the Paris climate deal is set to go into effect way earlier than expected

Besides North Carolina, NextGen is getting the word out in Nevada, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio and Colorado. In Pennsylvania, the group is working on more than 90 campuses, including Penn State University, where the organization has booths set up with volunteers trying to stop students walking by, just for a few seconds.

Volunteers with NextGen talk to potential voters about risks posed by climate change: rising sea levels, more flooding, intense storms and droughts. Volunteers helped students register, then asked them to fill out a personal commitment card.

Jonathan Killner, a Penn State senior speaking with potential voters, said, ""This is just saying that, come November, you're going to be voting for people who have climate change at the forefront of their policy and who actually care about our planet.""

For NextGen, that's neither Trump nor Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson. Johnson says climate change is ""probably"" happening, but suggests the government shouldn't regulate greenhouse gasses.

Green Party candidate Jill Stein is calling for the country to have 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. But she's polling in the low single digits.

But are those other candidates the wrong choices, or is Hillary Clinton the right choice?

""Hillary Clinton is the right person to be president this year,"" said Aleigha Cavalier, NextGen's director of communications in Pennsylvania. ""During the first presidential debate, Clinton came out swinging on climate change. When asked about the economy, the first thing she went to was transitioning to clean energy sources.""

Cavalier says they've connected with close to 50,000 young voters in the state. The group also advocates for down-ticket candidates with progressive climate policies. But can you motivate voters with quick conversations like, ""Hey, take a minute to fight climate change?""

""It's really tough to do,"" said Jonathan Chavez with SocialSphere, a polling research firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Chavez says NextGen faces an uphill battle getting millennials excited about Clinton.

""We recently conducted a focus group down in Philadelphia with undecided [millennial] voters, where seven of the eight of them said that if given the choice they would vote for a third Obama term over any of the candidates that were out there right now,"" Chavez said.

Young voters did turn out in huge numbers for Bernie Sanders, but that enthusiasm hasn't rolled over to the Clinton campaign.

Chavez says the other challenge NextGen faces is just getting young voters excited about the environment. Environmental issues rank toward the bottom for American voters as a whole. And Chavez says it's not a top issue for millennials either.

""One of things we hear over and over again is that the first thing millennials do in the morning is they wake up and turn on their phone to check their bank account balance to make sure that they have enough to get through the day. When you're having those issues that are driving you, it's really hard for climate change to break through as the deciding factor in an election,"" Chavez said.

Young people I met on Penn State's campus working with NextGen Climate disagree with that though, and argue climate change is top of mind for young voters.

""I believe that this is really a huge challenge that our generation is going to have to face,"" said Corinna Munn with NextGen. ""We're going to have to face the consequences of what everybody before us has done, or failed to do.""",2016-10-10,environmentalists to millennials: donald trump's climate policies are dangerous,Environmentalists to millennials: Donald Trump's climate policies are dangerous,['are'],['millennials'],"['environmentalists', 'policies', 'are']",0.0

According to a new survey released Thursday by online legal platform Willful, British Columbians could do a better job of preparing for the inevitable.

The company surveyed 800 British Columbians and found 58 per cent do not have a will. This follows the national trend, with 56 per cent of Canadians saying the same, according to statistics cited by Willful.

Millennials are among the worst prepared. The survey suggests 90 per cent of them in B.C. do not have a legal document that sets out what should be done with their money and property after they die. Similarly, 88 per cent of Canadians between the ages of 27 to 34 don't either.

Why are millennials moving to this rough-hewn california city?,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/04/30/why-are-millennials-moving-to-this-rough-hewn-california-city/,"Try to name the California city that recently settled into the Top 10 list of what the National Association of Realtors is calling the ""Most Popular Areas for Millennials: Where They Move And Stay.""

San Luis Obispo? Nice try. Eureka? Not even close. Palm Springs? Wrong again.

According to the NAR survey released the other day, Bakersfield joined nine other metro areas that are, in some cases surprisingly, attracting young job-seekers like never before.

""A wide range of factors contribute to why millennials decide to move to certain areas, remain for an extended period or choose to relocate shortly after their arrival,"" according to the study's authors. ""Job market and affordability in the given location are two of the main reasons that impact millennials the most.""

Those words should resonate with millennials now living in the Bay Area, brought here by the lure of employment but now growing weary of nose-bleed real-estate prices, prohibitively expensive rents, thickening urban congestion and soul-crushing commutes. Many young workers have already departed for more economical climes, and a lot of those folks apparently are heading to places such as Bakersfield.

""The NAR analyzed employment gains, population trends, income levels and housing conditions in the largest 100 metropolitan statistical areas across the country to identify the best purchase markets for millennial homebuyers,"" the authors wrote. ""The top 10 metro areas NAR identified were chosen for their above-average share of current millennial residents and recent movers, favorable employment opportunities and relatively low qualifying incomes needed to purchase a home.""

The report looked at employment gains, population trends, income levels and housing conditions in the largest 100 metropolitan statistical areas across the country to sort out the most popular destinations for millennials. NAR found that Madison, Wisc., is one of the top destinations for millennials, saying 75% ""of recent movers to the city have been millennials. Additionally, this segment of the population has mostly elected to remain in the area.""

The survey also concluded that one corner of the Golden State is a popular home-buying destination for the 20-something set. That's where Bakersfield comes in. Although many California residents who've passed through this dusty outpost in the Central Valley might find it hard to believe, this home to bad air, Basque food and country singer Merle Haggard is a place where 67% of recent newcomers are millennials. Why? Simple, says the NAR: Bakersfield is one of the most affordable metro areas in the state.

And all those easily attainable homes, condos and apartments are like catnip to young professionals. ""Of the millennials who most recently moved there, they can afford to purchase nearly 15 percent of the homes listed for sale,"" says the study. "" This is in comparison to neighboring Los Angeles, where millennials can only afford to buy 4 percent of listed homes.

""The increasing employment rate in California is another strong selling point among this generation,"" says NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. ""While the rate of unemployment in Bakersfield is higher than it is nationwide, we're seeing job growth there pick up at a strong pace. Home building in Bakersfield is rising, too. Many newcomers to San Francisco and Los Angeles do not stay for long because of unaffordability. Millennials moving to Bakersfield meanwhile are looking to take advantage of conditions toward homeownership.""

All of this, of course, is fine. But before you pack up the van and head for the valley, here are some things you might want to know about Bakersfield:

Music galore

Home to country-western singers Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, Bakersfield has assembled a proud collection of live-music venues past and present, including local bars such as On The Rocks, Sandrini's, Riley's and The Padre. Other spots have included B Ryders Sports Bar and Grill in southwest Bakersfield, Rabobank Arena, Bakersfield Convention Center, Fox Theater and Buck Owens Crystal Palace, still a Bakersfield cultural landmark.

A Nazi flag in the classroom

Bakersfield high school history teacher David Gaeta drew widespread anger in February after he displayed a Nazi flag in the classroom as a prop for teaching about the Holocaust. The swastika symbol's display did not play out well among many students, even as Gaeta's son, Gabriel, defended his dad by saying that for the past decade he had displayed the flag is his classroom when students were studying the Holocaust.

What's up, Doc?

Bakersfield put baby carrots on the map -- and vice versa: The local and legendary Grimmway Farms is the largest grower, producer and shipper of carrots in the world. The company, which has been family-owned and -operated for four decades, was created after brothers Rodney and Robert Grimm started farming a few acres on their family's chicken farm in Anaheim. They segued to baby carrots when that concept was test-marketed by another producer in L.A. The rest is carrot history: One report about the bite-sized crunchy snacks says Grimmway Farms now handles 10 million pounds of carrots a day, while another says it grows more than 40,000 acres of carrots.

Don't breathe the Air

Nestled in a bowl formed by the Sierra Nevada mountains to the east and the California Coast Ranges to the west, Bakersfield has long carried the mantel when it comes to bad air. Thanks to a toxic mix of emissions from agriculture, rail freight, heavy highway truck traffic and other industries in the region, the fast-growing city remains a bastion of air pollution. As The Guardian put it in a 2017 article, the toxins ""create one of the country's worst concentrations of air pollution - a condition exacerbated by geographic and climatic conditions that trap dry, dirty air over this southern section of Central Valley like the lid over a pot."" The American Lung Association's State of the Air 2016 report found Bakersfield's air to be the nastiest in the U.S. ""for short-term and year-round particle pollution, and the second worst for ozone pollution.""

A Basque Banquet

Good Basque food is plentiful in and around Bakersfield, which boasts what some say is probably the largest cluster of Basque restaurants in California; at one time or another, they've included the legendary Maitia's, known for its garlic fried chicken before going belly-up in 2008, as well as Noriega's, Benji's, Narducci's, The Pyrenees, Chalet and Woolgrowers, many of which are in East Bakersfield.

From Paris to Bakersfield

Here's how one reviewer on IMDb describes the FX series ""Baskets,"" which was co-created by Louis C.K., Zach Galifianakis and Jonathan Krisel and stars Galifianakis:

""Chip Baskets has a dream: become a classically trained French clown in Paris. Things don't go as well as he'd like, though, largely because of an impenetrable language barrier. With his lack of success overseas and mounting financial problems, Chip moves back home to Bakersfield, Calif., which presents other challenges for the wannabe jester. Going back home means having to confront his past, and compete with his siblings for his mother's approval. Even though he didn't make it as a clown in France, Chip is sort of living his dream -- as a rodeo clown.""",2019-04-30,why are millennials moving to this rough-hewn california city?,Why are millennials moving to this rough-hewn California city?,"['are', 'moving']",['this rough-hewn California city'],"['millennials', 'moving']",1.0
Lotteries struggling to attract millennials,http://www.mississauga.com/news-story/6760850-lotteries-struggling-to-attract-millennials/,"TORONTO -- Millennials are saying ""meh"" to traditional lotteries with big money and long odds, but if they never jump into the game en masse, provinces could be the ones missing out on the windfalls.

High jackpots are the main factor that drive strong lottery sales, with billions of dollars from lotteries each year going to areas such as health care and education.

But whether they see vying for large jackpots as futile, don't shop where lottery tickets are sold, or long for more instant gratification in their gambling, few young people are playing, and Canadian lottery corporations are looking for new ways to attract them.

In Ontario, where the province relies on the approximately $2 billion in annual revenue from the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp., OLG recently reported that just seven per cent of adults under 35 play the lottery at least once a week, compared to 45 per cent of all adult Ontarians.

Lottery tickets are not being sold in the same places young people are shopping, the report suggests. While OLG launched an online portal in early 2015, the ""vast majority"" of lottery tickets in Ontario are still purchased in person.

""The majority of Ontario adults under 35 years of age frequently visit supermarkets, big box stores and large retail locations where OLG products are not conveniently located or are currently not offered for sale,"" the report said.

OLG is considering expanding lottery sales to those places, including allowing ticket sales in all check-out lanes of a grocery store instead of one stand-alone customer service desk, said spokesman Rui Brum.

Lottery sales in Ontario were down $115 million in the fiscal year 2014-2015, but many lotteries across Canada also reported declines in that period, as there were fewer high-value jackpots and lower national lottery sales of Lotto Max and Lotto 6/49.

Representatives from lottery corporations across the country said the typical lottery does not seem to appeal to millennials. Loto-Quebec, where 18-to-34-year-olds are 27 per cent of the population but just 17 per cent of lottery players, said games of pure chance don't attract that generation.

Andrea Marantz, a spokeswoman for the Western Canada Lottery Corporation, said the lottery is a ""life stage"" game, appealing more to middle-aged or older adults.

""Part of that would be they have more discretionary income for entertainment purposes, but one thing that we've really found here is the most common thing we hear from our winners...is they don't have to worry about money at all,"" she said.

""Maybe when you are young and just starting your professional life...those money worries aren't weighing quite as heavily.""

About 47 per cent of adults in Western Canada said they had played a lottery in the past month, compared to 32 per cent for adults 30 and under, Marantz said.

The WCLC and other Canadian lottery corporations are working with the Interprovincial Lottery Corp. to try to develop a new national lottery aimed at people under 35. Work began in 2014, but is ongoing, Marantz said.

Attracting younger adults involves more than just putting existing games online, said Jean-Marc Landry, director of customer innovation for the Atlantic Lottery Corporation. One ALC idea that is decidedly low-tech is mailing scratch-and-win tickets like a coffee of the month club, he said.

""We tested the idea on our (market research) panel and by far in appeal it scored the highest among 19-34 year olds,"" Landry said. ""We were so surprised.""

Pro-Line sports betting also does well with that generation, as do games that are more about entertainment than seeking financial security, he said.

Jeffrey Derevensky, a McGill University professor who studies youth gambling problems, said instant and sports games are most popular with younger people.

""Whether or not they have sat down and said, 'The odds of winning are just unbelievably huge'... What we find with young people is they're more interested in actually the scratch tickets because they're looking for the immediate gratification,"" he said.

""Sports are extremely popular, especially amongst young males, who believe they know everything about sports,"" said the educational and counselling psychology professor.

NDP MP Brian Masse has a private member's bill before the House of Commons to legalize single sport betting. He said billions are going to organized crime and the provinces could use that money for health care, education and infrastructure.

But the Liberal government indicated it would not support it, acknowledging there would be economic advantages, but greater concerns about gambling addictions.

"Jpmorgan chase launched an online bank for millennials called finn, and i prefer it to the real thing",https://www.businessinsider.com.au/jpmorgan-chase-online-bank-finn-for-millennials-2018-7,"I tried it and I definitely like it more than my traditional Chase account.

Finn, a mobile bank built by Chase, recently rolled out nationwide. And I gave it a try.

In addition to offering bread-and-butter checking and savings account functionality, it also offers services many firms in the personal finance startup space have built their businesses around. These include automatic saving tools and charts to see where you are spending money.

The point of the app is to help Chase expand in regions where it doesn't have branches by luring folks who don't need to use branch-related services.

Personally, I think the app is a better experience than my traditional Chase mobile bank, since it more easily allows you to send checks from the app, save money in an easy and fun way, and keep track of your spending. It's also free. And there's no overdraft fees. But it's not without flaws.

First, the app is pretty ugly. It also has a weird portal that allows you to rate your transactions with emojis, which I think is pointless.

In any case, here's a walk through I put together to share my experience. Enjoy.

To be sure, you don't need to bank with Chase to open a Finn account. In fact, new customers are eligible for $US100 when they open an account. The sign-up process is just as quick as other personal finance apps, requiring information like date-of-birth, address, and Social Security number.

The interface is pretty simple with three portals: savings, checking, trends.

In the checking account section you can see a breakdown of your financial transactions, including money coming in and coming out. I transferred $US850 from my traditional Chase account via the app in a matter of seconds. I used that money to pay for my rent (More on that later). But that transaction shows up as ""bills & utilities."" Through the trends portal, users can get a sense of where their money is being spent. It definitely falls short of the budgeting features of companies such as Mint and Personal Capital.

Since I only bought one thing on my account so far, I will use an example from Chase to show what the trend portal looks like after a user makes a number of purchases. You can see a breakdown for each month. There's over 10 categories including shopping, transportation, travel, and home.

The savings shows you how much money you are bringing in from your various autosave rules and transfers. To put money into savings you simply can move it from checking in seconds. Or set up rules that automatically transfer the cash from checking to savings based on a number of factors.

The app's autosave rules expand on the functionality popularised by investment apps such as Acorns, Digit, and Stash. Acorns, which is known for pioneering so-called round-up investments, allows users to invest the spare change from checking account purchases in the markets. Finn users can do something similar. The so-called Pocket Your Pennies rule rounds up checking account purchases and transfers them over to a user's savings, not the markets.

This rule, which I hope is a humorous tip of the hat to ""Mean Girls,"" allows a user to save a certain amount of money whenever a user spends a certain amount. As an example, I instituted this rule to save $US2 whenever I spend $US20 until I reach the limit of $US250. I will use that cash for a trip to the Alamo in Texas.

Through the move money tab you can pay your bills, send money to friends via Zelle, deposit checks, and mail a check.

You can set bills and check payments to be reoccurring so they go out automatically without you having to do anything.

The fact that you can send checks from the app was especially appealing to me. It takes about a week for them to print it and then send to the recipient.

For some reason the app allows you to rate your transaction. I don't know why anyone would want to do it. But Chase told me that people really like it.

If you like it, can you please email me at [email protected] and explain why.

Since Finn customers don't get access to bank branch services, they can only withdraw money from Chase ATMs and partner ATMs. In areas where there are no bank branches, such as on Cape Cod where I am vacationing, there's a number of partner ATMs from which you can withdraw cash at no cost.",2018-07-08,"jpmorgan chase launched an online bank for millennials called finn, and i prefer it to the real thing","JPMorgan Chase launched an online bank for millennials called Finn, and I prefer it to the real thing","['launched', 'called', 'prefer']","['an online bank', 'millennials', 'it', 'the real thing']","['chase', 'launched', 'i']",0.0
Most boomers likely won't downsize for another 20 years  --  too late for millennials,https://globalnews.ca/news/5345954/boomers-not-downsizing/,"North Americans are known to move through a fairly predictable ""housing life cycle.""

Phase 1 is living in tiny apartments next to the downtown core during university and the first years of one's career. Phase 2 usually kicks in when people start having kids, which prompts them to leave behind condos and roommates in favour of a home with a backyard. Then, typically around the beginning of retirement, comes Phase 3: downsizing.

Story continues below

Older millennials -- those born in the 1980s -- are now having children and entering Phase 2. Canadian women are having their first baby at 30, on average, around six years later than the typical age at first birth in the 1950s and '60s, according to Statistics Canada. But that shift forward is much smaller compared to the delay with which boomers may hit Phase 3 of the homeownership cycle.

Forget moving to a smaller home at 65. Boomers, many of whom are now hitting their 60s, aren't expected to start downsizing in a meaningful way until at least 2040 or later, when many will be in their 80s, according to a 2018 Ryerson University study of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) funded by the Ontario Real Estate Association.

READ MORE: Should you postpone buying a home to save for a larger down payment?

That's a problem for millennials who are dreaming of a home with front and back lawns -- or at least one with a few more bedrooms. Baby boomers own most of those houses and aren't inclined to move out anytime soon -- if at all, according to Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs.

A survey of boomer homeowners conducted by Ipsos for HomeEquity Bank last year found that fully one-half said they have no plans to downsize at all.

WATCH: Is too much of your money tied up in real estate?

Many reasons not to downsize

""If you're living longer and healthier in a community that you like and you've already paid for your house ... [you] don't leave,"" Bricker said.

Canadians who turned 65 between 2015 and 2017 can expect to live another two decades, according to StatCan. For many, the physical exertion of things like climbing stairs, cleaning gutters and picking weeds won't be an issue for years, Bricker said.

There are many other reasons for boomers not to downsize. Some are finding that trading their single-family home for an apartment won't free up as much cash as expected once transaction costs are factored in.

READ MORE: Reverse mortgage, downsizing or HELOC? The best way to boost your retirement income

In some places, like Vancouver, where the market has turned from sizzling hot to stone cold over the past couple of years, some have been forced to push the pause button on downsizing simply because they can't sell their home. With sales of detached homes in the city at a 28-year low, even boomers who do want to move to a smaller place are having to shelve those plans for now, said Vancouver real estate agent Steve Saretsky.

On the other hand, those who never want to downsize have more ways to do so. Reverse mortgages, which are growing in popularity, allow Canadians aged 55 and over to draw down on a portion of their home equity in exchange for payments that typically boost their retirement income -- all while maintaining the ability to live in their home.

Further down the line, at-home long-term care is also expected to allow more aging boomers to stay put until the very end, Bricker said.

WATCH: Weighing the costs and benefits of reverse mortgages

Jobs tie both boomers and millennials to the largest cities

In the near future, though, one major reason that's going to keep boomers in their current homes is the desire to keep working well beyond age 65.

""They usually go through what's called 'bridge employment,'"" scaling back their hours but continuing to work, Bricker said.

""This means they have to have some access to what provides them with working opportunities, which is usually the city,"" he added.

But cities are also where the jobs are for millennials.

Take Toronto and its surroundings, for example. While the downtown core of Ontario's capital added more than 150,000 jobs between 2006 and 2016, some of the smaller communities in the region saw net job losses over the same period, mostly due to declining employment in manufacturing, according to a study authored by urban planner Pamela Blais for the Neptis Foundation.

The Ryerson study, which focused on a similar area around Toronto and Lake Ontario, forecast a potential deficit of around 70,000 houses with backyards as millennials' demand for family-friendly properties grows over the next decade.

Bricker sees similar forces at work in Canada's other major real estate markets. Almost 40 per cent of the country's population, he noted, now lives in just four cities: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.

Immigration is also adding to those pressures, with most newcomers clustering around the big urban centres, he added. Thanks to immigrants, Canada has the fastest population growth among the G7 group of industrialized countries.

""More and more people are flocking to the city, and unless you're creating a huge new supply of housing, they're just simply going to drive the price of houses up,"" Bricker said.

According to Statistics Canada, almost 85 per cent of employed Canadians live in urban areas.

Where will millennials raise their families?

Impossibly high real estate prices are pushing many young Canadians into suburbs further and further away from the big cities. A recent report by RBC found there were 13,200 more millennials who moved from Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal to areas within the same province than millennials flocking the opposite way last year. Taken together, that outflow has more than tripled since 2015 in the three cities. In Vancouver alone, the exodus has increased almost eight-fold.

But all three cities are also drawing plenty of new, young blood, the same research found. The inflow of 20- to 34-year-olds coming from out of province or another country more than makes up for those who are packing up in search of more affordable digs.

In Toronto, economist Diana Petramala, who co-authored the Ryerson report, sees generation Z -- those born starting in the late 1990s -- gradually joining and eventually replacing millennials in the city's condo towers. Meanwhile, those upsizing to start families will likely be forced into long commutes between a downtown job and an affordable home in a distant suburb. A smaller group of millennials will adapt to raise kids in condo apartments, she added.

READ MORE: Generation Z -- make room for Canada's connected, open and optimistic generation

Meanwhile, a growing share of Ontarians is set to age in outsized homes. One analysis by the Canadian Centre for Economic Analysis estimated the province currently has five million spare bedrooms, mostly owned by overhoused homeowners aged 65 and over.

Down the line, Bricker sees some young families flocking back to those empty nests.

READ MORE: Financially helping adult kids may just be a return to an old normal

When boomers start entering their 80s, and their children live an hour and a half away in the suburbs, perhaps it will make sense to divide up grandma and grandpa's house, he said.

Adult children will take care of their aging parents, who will, in turn, help with child care.

That way, Bricker said, everyone gets to live ""in the best possible neighbourhood.""

Canadian millennials expect to live better than parents in retirement: study - stettler independent,https://www.stettlerindependent.com/news/canadian-millennials-expect-to-live-better-than-parents-in-retirement-study/,"Study questions 'unrealistic expectations' of young Canadians

An new study released Monday shows a disconnect between millennials' financial realities and retirement expectations.

The study, conducted by Angus Reid Institute, finds one-in-three Canadians (32 per cent) have put off saving for retirement because of their debt. Millions more - especially those under the age of 40 - have put off buying a home (18 per cent), getting married (8 per cent), having children (7 per cent) or moving out of their parents' homes (5 per cent).

Despite relatively few young Canadians reporting job stability or having more than $25,000 saved, they seem to be looking toward retirement with surprising optimism, the study found.

Young people are more likely to view their debt as significant and - though they mostly feel this debt is manageable - more than four-in-ten Canadians ages 26-37 say they have put off saving for retirement because of it.

At the same time, on average the youngest Canadians expect to retire earlier and live better in retirement compared to their elders.

Roughly one-third of older Canadians expect to struggle to make ends meet during retirement, and anticipate relying on funds from the government or work pensions.

Meanwhile, younger Canadians are more likely to expect to use personal retirement savings to do everything they want after concluding their careers.

""How young Canadians plan to achieve this expected level of comfort in retirement is an open question,"" the study said.

Overall, the study found more than three-quarters of Canadians are carrying debt.

For every dollar of disposable income, Canadians reported owing about $1.78 to creditors, for a collective total of more than $2 trillion.

The study suggests this debt is causing notable financial strain for more than four-in-ten people in the country.

"Introducing joon, the new airline for millennials",http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/air-france-joon-airline-for-millennials/,"Air France is launching a new airline aimed at millennials whose ""lifestyles revolve around digital technology"", the carrier has announced.

Scheduled to launch this September, Joon will offer an ""innovative and offbeat"" experience to its ""young and connected"" jet-setting clientele, claims Air France.

""This new brand has been entirely designed to meet their requirements and aspirations,"" the carrier said in a statement.

Sporting a more hip and casual feel, passengers can expect to be served by cabin crew wearing electric blue-coloured ""basic and chic"" uniforms (think white trainers, blazers with rolled up sleeves, polo shirts and ankle-length trousers).

July 20, 2017

The crew's apparel, which was reportedly inspired by workers a Silicon Valley start-up, is supposed to capture the airline's ""dynamic attitude"".

A millennial typically describes someone aged between 18 and 35 years old, though that definition has been a source of much debate. Air France told CNN that 40-year-old passengers would be allowed to fly Joon, however it is unclear whether passengers who fall further outside the millennial age bracket will be welcome onboard. It is also unclear whether cabin crew must be millennials.

Air France could not confirm where it will be flying, how much tickets will cost or whether there would be any services designed with millennials in mind, such as an enhanced in-flight entertainment system or a targeted food and drink menu. It did, however, reveal that Joon would not be a low-cost carrier.

Further information about the new airline will follow in September when Joon is expected to launch European routes from Paris; long-haul flights will follow in 2018, Telegraph Travel understand. The new carrier will use single-aisle Airbus A320s, as well as long-range twin-aisle A340s and A350s.

""This generation has inspired us a lot,"" said Caroline Fontaine, VP Brand at Air France, describing millennials.

The buzzwords around every city in India nowadays seem to ""au-naturale"" ""artisanal"" and ""homegrown"". Keeping up with this latest trend is entrepreneur Angad Soni who recently launched an exclusive line of tonic waters and mixers based out of Delhi called Sepoy & Co. While multinational companies churn out tonic waters, it's been a long time coming since someone realised that there needs to be an original Indian brand, albeit small, but one that makes the product with a exclusive twist.

""Our story started halfway between New Delhi and London, sipping G & T's in the air. That trip turned into an extensive tasting of Gin and Tonics (mostly Tonics) and a question -- 'Why?' Why are there no premium natural mixers available in India to mix with all the great Gin's we buy?"" says Soni. Which is why he went on to create a world class tonic or ""premium adult soft beverage"" as he prefers to call it, which is both 100 percent natural and can cater to the unique tastes of the Indian palate. Thus with plenty of diligence, patience and over a years hard work resulted in Sepoy & Co.. Soni worked with industry experts and distillers across India and England, to finally be satisfied with a perfectly balanced tonic water.

Sepoy & Co. uses a unique blend of essential oils and spices with quinine and just the right amount of carbonation, so that the products can make an accompaniment to spirit or even be enjoyed just as they are -- a stand-alone soft beverage. It is expertly brewed in India, following the highest quality manufacturing and bottling practices.

Millennials are wreaking havoc on these 18 industries - strategy - pulse,https://www.pulse.com.gh/bi/strategy/millennials-are-wreaking-havoc-on-these-18-industries-id8933311.html,"But, in 2018, failing to win over millennials can mean the difference between growth and death for an industry.

Millennials are growing up, moving out of their parents' homes, and having kids of their own. But, their tastes still don't necessarily line up with those of the generations that came before in some key ways.

From napkins to motorcycles, here are the industries that have been hit hardest by millennials:

However, the fact remains that brands such as Buffalo Wild Wings, Ruby Tuesday, and Applebee's have faced sales slumps and dozens of restaurant closures as casual-dining chains have struggled to attract customers and increase sales.

Couples are increasingly ditching banquet halls and hotel reception rooms in favor of unconventional venues such as barns and farms, according to a survey from wedding website The Knot.

In general, weddings -- from venues to dresses -- are becoming more casual. Wedding planners told Business Insider that many clients are getting married later and funding their own weddings, meaning they don't have to stick to their parents' traditions.

""Ten years ago brides and grooms were relying on their parents to solely fund weddings,"" said one planner. ""Now people are empowered by doing what they want to do and they want it to be a reflection of who they are.""

Millennials simply aren't drinking as much beer as generations past.

Beer consumption among drinkers from 21 to 24 has fallen roughly 3% per year over the last 15 years. Beer penetration fell one percentage point in the US market from 2016 to 2017, while both wine and spirits were unmoved, according to Nielsen data. And, per-capita consumption of beer in the US dropped by nearly 10% from 2008 to 2017, according to Euromonitor data.

The brands that are being hit the hardest include massively popular American brands such as Coors and Bud Light.

According to Euromonitor, mayonnaise sales fell 6.7% in the US between 2012 and 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal reported that brands like Hellmann's and Kraft have had to slash prices to keep shoppers interested, with mayonnaise prices falling 0.6% from the first quarter of 2017 to 2018, as overall packaged-food prices increased by 1.6%, according to Nielsen data.

""Condiments are more competitive than they've ever been,"" Jennifer Healy, head of marketing for the Heinz brand, told the Journal. ""Ten years ago, it was much more simple.""

As millennials flock to e-commerce sites and fast-fashion brands like H&M and Zara, department stores such as Macy's and Sears have suffered, closing hundreds of stores across the US.

Part of the reason is that when millennials do spend money, they're spending more on experiences like restaurants and traveling. Millennials are less drawn to aspirational, designer brands, and they're perfectly happy saving money by buying private-label lines, which further hurts traditional department stores.

The rise of a laid-back approach to shaving, most popular among men under the age of 45, is causing some serious problems and strategic readjustments in the razor industry. CNN reports Gillette even had to stage an ""intervention"" last year, slashing prices by an average of 12% and pushing facial-hair-maintenance tools like a beard trimmer.

According to Gillette, studies show that the average number of times men shave per month has fallen from 3.7 to 3.2 over the last decade. As a result, razor-industry sales fell 5.1% by June, compared to the year prior.

Fertility hit a record low in 2016, bringing the rate among women ages 15 to 44 to 62 births per 1,000 women. And, that's creating issues for industries aimed at babies and children.

""Most of our end-customers are newborns and children and, as a result, our revenues are dependent on the birth rates in countries where we operate,"" Toys R Us wrote in its 2017 annual filing, prior to filing for bankruptcy. ""In recent years, many countries' birth rates have dropped or stagnated as their population ages, and education and income levels increase.""

Toys R Us isn't alone. Though they haven't had to resort to bankruptcy, Build A Bear and local toy stores have reported similar issues.

People ages 18 to 24 are 19% less likely to search for breasts on the pornographic website Pornhub compared with all other age groups, according to an analysis conducted by the website.

For ""breastaurants"" like Hooters and Twin Peaks, a loss of interest in breasts is bad for business. The number of Hooters locations in the US dropped by more than 7% from 2012 to 2016, and sales have stagnated, according to industry reports.

Hooters has struggled to win over millennials for some time now. In 2012, the chain attempted to revamp its image with updated decor and new menu items to attract more millennial and female customers. Earlier this year, the chain announced plans to boost sales by expanding its delivery business.

""Delivery [solves] the polarizing issue the brand has had,"" CEO Terry Marks said at the ICR Retail conference in January.

""Many people wouldn't step foot in our restaurants, but they want our product,"" he said.

Cereal sales have hit a slump over the last few years. US cereal sales have dropped 11% over the last five years, hitting roughly $9 billion in 2017, according to Mintel data.

Almost 40% of millennials surveyed by Mintel said cereal was an inconvenient breakfast choice because they had to clean up after eating it, The New York Times reported in 2016.

Instead, younger consumers are turning to convenient options that can be eaten on the go with minimal cleanup, from yogurt to fast-food breakfast sandwiches.

""Our data suggests the younger Gen Y population is adopting motorcycling at a far lower rate than prior generations,"" AB analyst David Beckel said in a 2017 note downgrading its rating of Harley-Davidson shares from ""outperform"" to ""market perform.""

Harley-Davidson is debuting new models and partnerships in an attempt to attract younger Americans to the brand.

""Younger people aren't taking up motorcycles like they used to, and that's led to a long slide in the size of the market in the US, which is already quite competitive,"" Business Insider's Matthew DeBord reported in July. ""The Harley image of open-road freedom doesn't necessarily dovetail with the enthusiasm of millennials for city living.""

A UBS report from earlier this year estimates that by 2030, online food delivery could command 10% of the total food-services market. And, that could spell bad news for companies known for their ready-made or home-prepared meals, such as General Mills and Kraft Heinz.

""At scale, ubiquitous on-demand and subscription delivery of prepared food could potentially spell the end of cooking at home,"" the UBS report states.

Plain old ""spoonable"" yogurt is being swept aside for newer variations, with Mintel predicting a 5% decline in overall sales from 2017 to 2022. General Mills reported in September that yogurt sales dropped 2% in the US in the most recent quarter, due to declines in Greek and light yogurt sales.

Instead, General Mills is turning to up-and-coming types of yogurt to boost sales, such as ""French-style"" Oui by Yoplait.

""In July, we added our presence in simply better yogurt with YQ, a new yogurt made with ultra-filtered milk that appeal to modern weight managers, seeking high protein, less sugar, simple ingredients and great taste and is 99% lactose-free,"" CEO Jeff Harmening said in a call with investors.

In 2006, soda sales by volume declined in the United States for the first time in 20 years. Every year since then, the decline has continued, with Coke and Pepsi brands falling 2% and 4.5%, respectively, by volume in the US in 2017, according to Beverage Digest.

Many of Coca-Cola's attempts to boost sales have focused on convincing millennials to buy lower-calorie beverages.

Bar soap sales fell 2.2% from 2014 to 2015, a time when the rest of the shower-and-bath category grew, according to Mintel.

And, millennials are at least partly to blame.

""Almost half (48%) of all US consumers believe bar soaps are covered in germs after use, a feeling that is particularly strong among consumers aged 18-24 (60%), as opposed to just 31% of older consumers aged 65-plus,"" Mintel wrote in a press release.

The Post points to a survey conducted by Mintel, which highlights that only 56% of shoppers said they had bought napkins in the past six months. At the same time, 86% surveyed said they had purchased paper towels.

Paper towels are more functional than napkins and can be used for more purposes. And the Post noted that millennials are more likely to eat meals outside of the home, contributing to the decline.

Sales of liquid fabric softeners fell 15% in the US from 2007 to 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported. Market leader Downy fell 26% in the same period.

National parks chief: system must appeal more to millennials,http://www.seattlepi.com/news/us/article/National-Parks-chief-System-building-appeal-to-6801974.php,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The National Park Service needs to broaden its appeal to millennials as it celebrates its 100th birthday this year, the director of the agency said Tuesday as he touted civil rights sites that aren't traditionally viewed as parks to a younger audience.

Park Service Director Jon Jarvis spoke during a visit to the Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site, marking the formerly all-white institution that was desegregated by nine black students in 1957.

Part of the plan to attract more 18- to 35-year-olds to national parks, Jarvis said, includes a ""Find Your Park"" website and social media campaign that the service and the National Park Foundation launched last year to promote the parks and encourage people to share their experiences.

""We set a goal for our centennial, which is to create and connect with the next generation of park visitors, supporters and advocates,"" Jarvis told The Associated Press in an interview at the Central High site. He says he's tasked every park to ""think about what they do on a day-to-day basis, in their existing operations and what more they could do that will achieve that goal. What are they doing to connect with the next generation?""

Jarvis said the effort includes highlighting civil rights sites such as Central High School. He also plans a visit this month to the Colonel Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers Monument in Ohio, which commemorates one of the first African-Americans to graduate from West Point and the first black to achieve the rank of colonel in the U.S. Army. After that, he plans to visit the New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park.

""We put a lot of emphasis on them because we think they are key to being relevant to a much more diverse generation that we have out there,"" Jarvis said. ""Clearly we already know statistically that the visitation to the national parks does not represent the diversity of the nation and we want to change that dynamic.""

Jarvis compared the effort to reach a younger audience to the National Park Service's ten-year ""Mission 66"" program launched in 1956 to expand and improve its facilities.

""It's a modern invitation to that generation to find their park, find that space, find that place, find that story that resonates with them,"" he said.",2016-02-03,national parks chief: system must appeal more to millennials,National Parks chief: System must appeal more to millennials,"['must', 'appeal']",['millennials'],"['chief', 'system', 'appeal']",0.0

Millennials may not be too lazy to eat cereal!,http://www.newkerala.com/news/2016/fullnews-28737.html,"New York, March 1 : Countering a recent report that said millennials have cut down cereal consumption as it requires doing the dishes after eating, a new article in Live Science suggests that the youth may be eating less cereal but not because they are lazy. A New York Times food column on cereal last week reported that 40 percent of millennials said cereal is an inconvenient food because it requires clean-up after eating.

The report led to an eruption of internet outrage with many even mocking fun at millennials for their behaviour.

""Overall, only six percent of all consumers say they're eating less cereal than the year before, according to the same Mintel marketing report that included the 40 percent statistic,"" the Live Science reported.

""And the report did not directly link millennials' feelings about convenience with declines in cereal consumption,"" it said.

Moreover, according to analysts, sales in cereals could also fall because people are more conscious about avoiding carbohydrates consumption.

The Mintel report, released in August 2015, drew its data from a survey of 1,912 participants aged 18 or older.

These participants were asked, ""Which of the following statements about cold or hot cereal do you agree with?"" One option was ""Cereal is inconvenient because I have to clean dishes after preparing it.""

Thirty-nine percent of millennials (those born between about 1980 and 2000) said they agreed, as did 17 percent of Generation Xers (born between the mid-1960s and 1980) and 10 percent of baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964).

Millennials were also more likely than other generations to agree that cereal should be more portable.

How esports is keeping the elusive millennials engaged,https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/28/how-esports-is-keeping-the-elusive-millennials-engaged/,"Esports may not be bigger than traditional sports when it comes to revenues yet. But the industry is in its early days, and the good thing is that it is keeping a highly desirable demographic very engaged with both esports spectating and game playing.

Peter Levin is chairman of Immortals esports team as well as president of Interactive Ventures, Games & Digital Strategy at Lionsgate, the movie studio that created films such as The Hunger Games. Yvette Martinez-Rea is CEO and managing director of esports tournament company ESL North America. They both spoke about the growth of esports at our GamesBeat Summit 2018 event.

Nielsen recently compared the esports demographic -- about 70 percent male, ages 13 to 40 -- to soccer fans, and it said they are ""irresistible"" to brand advertisers. But they're hard for advertisers to target, as they only watch about four hours of TV per week. They spend twice as much time playing games. They follow an average of 5.7 games and 2.6 game genres.

Esports fans use social networks ranging from Reddit (22 percent) to Facebook (57 percent). In the U.S., about 66 percent say they watch livestreams of esports live, while only 37 percent attend live esports events. For the most part, esports fans aren't as excited about viewing traditional sports. About 66 percent of U.S. esports fans watch football, while just 39 percent watch boxing.

Market researcher Newzoo expects that global esports revenue will grow 38 percent to $906 million in 2018 and hit $1.65 billion by 2021. Esports will continue to be smaller in revenues than traditional sports, but it is rapidly gaining in terms of numbers of spectators. Once those spectators start spending like traditional sports fans, then advertisers will shift more money to esports and the industry will continue to gain momentum.

"Like their non-hispanic peers, latino millennials less enthusiastic about clinton",http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/politics-government/election/article107472712.html,"Hillary Clinton enjoys a sizable lead over Donald Trump among Hispanics in a new poll, but receives less positive backing from Latino millennials, many of whom describe their support as more anti-Trump than pro-Clinton.

The annual Pew Research Center National Survey of Latinos, found Clinton with 58 percent of the vote, compared to just 19 percent for Trump. Another 10 percent favor Libertarian Gary Johnson while 6 percent back Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee.

The poll suggests a troubling trend for Trump: in 2012, Barack Obama won 71 percent of the Latino vote in a two-way contest, while 27 percent backed Romney, according to national exit polls. That was one of the largest Democratic advantages among Latinos dating back more than two decades, Pew found at the time.

The poll, however, found a worrying trend for Clinton, as well. Her support is lagging among Hispanics 18 to 35 who will make up nearly half of the record 27.3 million Latinos estimated to be eligible to vote in 2016, Pew found.

Among younger Hispanics, 48 percent support Clinton, while 15 percent back Trump; just over 20 percent support Johnson and Stein and 11 percent chose another candidate or offered no opinion.

That contrasts with Clinton's support among Latino voters ages 36 and older: she has 66 percent of the vote to Trump's 21 percent, with Johnson and Stein trailing in the single digits.

The poll says that 64 percent of younger voters who do back Clinton describe their support as more of a vote against Trump than a vote for Clinton. But 65 percent of older Clinton supporters say their support is more of a vote for Clinton than a vote against Trump.

Pew notes a similar generation gap among Clinton voters more generally. In an August Pew poll, most younger voters who supported Clinton said they saw their vote more as anti-Trump. Most older Clinton supporters viewed their vote as pro-Clinton.

Trump's campaign comments about Hispanics - he kicked off his race in June 2015 by pledging to build a wall at the border with Mexico - have resonated. Three-quarters of Hispanic registered voters told Pew they've discussed the Republican candidate's comments about Hispanics or other groups with family, friends or coworkers in the past year.

The poll also found that the share of Latino registered voters who say they are ""absolutely certain"" they will vote in November -- 69 percent -- is down from the share who said the same in 2012 -- 77 percent. Among the sharpest declines -- 13 percent -- is among younger Latinos.",2016-10-11,"like their non-hispanic peers, latino millennials less enthusiastic about clinton","Like their non-Hispanic peers, Latino millennials less enthusiastic about Clinton",[],"['their non-Hispanic peers', 'Latino millennials', 'Clinton']",['like'],0.0
More millennials are signing prenups   --  and experts say that's a good thing,https://globalnews.ca/news/5270415/how-to-talk-about-prenups/,"Marriage is an exciting milestone in many people's lives, but for an increasing number of millennials, it's also an opportunity to talk break-ups.

Story continues below

According to research, more millennials in North America are getting prenuptial agreements before walking down the aisle. A recent U.S. survey found that an increasing number of young adults are requesting prenups through lawyers to cover things like protection of property, spousal support and division of assets.

Toronto-based family lawyer Rick Peticca says the same trend is happening in Canada.

READ MORE: Should you get a prenup or cohabitation agreement before settling down?

Peticca, who is a lawyer at Shulman Law Firm, says he's seeing more millennials asking for prenups and cohabitation agreements. Peticca says this trend has increased over the last five years or so.

""While I cannot comment on overall Canadian statistics on prenups, I can tell you that at Shulman Law Firm, the files that are marriage contracts are almost all exclusively millennials,"" he told Global News.

Andrea Syrtash, a relationship expert and author of Cheat on Your Husband (With Your Husband), echoes Peticca's experience, and says she's noticed more couples seeking legal agreements.

""People pursuing [prenups] recognize that some marriages don't last forever,"" Syrtash told Global News. ""And [they] want to be protected if their relationship doesn't work out.""

Why are millennials asking for prenups?

It may seem surprising that a generation commonly portrayed as being financially strapped is pushing for prenups. But according to experts, there are some good reasons as to why.

WATCH BELOW: How bickering couples can find peace

""[There are] several reasons which may explain the rise in prenups,"" Peticca said. ""Millennials are staying in school and working longer than 30 to 40 years ago, and so they are acquiring more wealth and income before getting married or cohabiting in a long-term relationship.""

Peticca said that millennials may also inherit more intra-generational wealth, either through their parents or grandparents. (The rise of parents and grandparents passing on ""living inheritances"" is an example of this trend.)

He says that times are changing, too, and the way in which people approach relationships is shifting. These days, people are concerned with protecting their assets since they are well aware that divorce rates are high.

READ MORE: Millennials account for highest RRSP contribution, according to BMO study

""With the increase in divorce rates over the last 40 to 50 years, the prevalence of growing up and being immersed in divorce has conditioned millennials to think differently about relationships and planning for an 'exit strategy,'"" Peticca explained.

""With the age of the internet and accessibility to information, millennials are more knowledgeable on how to approach relationships from a 'risk-management' point of view.""

What should a prenup entail?

Put simply, a prenup is a written agreement made between a couple before they marry. It outlines who is entitled to what should a divorce occur, and how assets will be divided.

According to Susan O'Brien, senior vice-president and senior wealth adviser at BMO Nesbitt Burns, it's important for couples to talk about their financial status and discuss their money goals as a couple. This talk should come before they say ""I do.""

WATCH BELOW: Couples use app to manage, organize divorce decisions

""When you're in a relationship with someone, you talk about all your hopes and dreams for tomorrow, and what your life is going to look like and how wonderful it's going to be,"" O'Brien told Global News. ""[But] you also have to get down to the business part of the relationship -- and prenups come under that business part.""

O'Brien says that you and your partner should determine how you want to protect your individual assets, debt, shared properties, investments and even things like life insurance policies.

""It's not just about what I have is mine and what you have is yours; it's also about the growth of those assets,"" she added.

How to talk about prenups

Experts say it can be hard to talk about prenups -- especially at the beginning of a relationship. Syrtash says that even if conversations around money and assets are uncomfortable, they are important.

""The reality is that many uncomfortable topics -- like debt, family dynamics, religion, sex -- should be brought to the table before marriage so you and your partner can feel aligned... before going into the long-term partnership,"" she said.

""When you approach the prenup conversation, say it in the spirit of wanting to be honest and on the same page about many uncomfortable topics, including that one.""

Syrtash said instead of coldly asserting your needs, start a conversation about why a prenup is important to you. She said that it's crucial to let your partner know you don't imagine divorce happening, but want to cover all bases since you know what can happen when couples aren't financially prepared.

""If you get resistance, ask your partner if she or he is willing to speak with a financial specialist or counsellor about it since it's important to you,"" she added.

WATCH BELOW: Divorce doesn't have to be detrimental to your family

O'Brien says as a wealth adviser, she is often that third party who addresses prenups. She says that she introduces many clients to the idea of a prenup when they're in her office talking about financial planning, which includes investing and mortgages.

If a client is in a serious relationship that could result in marriage, she says that it's important for them to talk openly about their financial goals with both her and their partner.

It's important to note, however, that not every couple wants a prenup, Syrtash said. ""Prenups are not important in every marriage, but my general relationship rule is if something is important to one person in a relationship, it's important,"" Syrtash said.

If you and your partner do decide to get a prenup, O'Brien says it's vital that a lawyer handles the contract to ensure all is sound. She also advises that both parties seek independent counsel to look over any documents. That way, each person can feel comfortable with the agreement.

While couples hope they should never need their prenups, the comfort they offer is invaluable, O'Brien says.

""They really give that peace of mind, like car insurance,"" she said. ""You hope to never use it, but it's there.""

Why millennials should consider disability insurance,https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/bills-to-pay/why-millennials-should-consider-disability-insurance/ar-BBSTd0Z,"The odds of being unable to work because of sickness or accidental injury are greater than the odds of a premature death. That's unlikely to be something millennials ever think about when planning for retirement. But they should.

Load Error

And that means they should consider disability income insurance, as boring as it sounds.

The question any working person needs to answer, says Kevin Lynch, a faculty instructor at The American College of Financial Services, is this: ""How will you support yourself the day you wake up but are unable to get up?""

To be sure, young workers - if a disability arises from a work-related accident or illness - will likely receive workers' compensation. And many employers do provide group short- and long-term disability coverage as a benefit.

But they might also need to purchase an individual disability income policy to supplement a group plan or provide additional coverage if a group plan is unavailable.

So, what should millennials consider?

Don't think it won't happen to you

Injuries happen, says Yan Katz, a financial adviser with The Bulfinch Group. Illnesses happen. ""We've all heard of someone who has gotten into a bad car accident or battled cancer,"" he says. 'To think it cannot happen to you is plain ... ludicrous.""

Your greatest asset?

Your best asset when you're a young worker is your earning potential. ""Millennials often need to be reminded that their ability to earn an income is their biggest asset,"" says Jennifer Lane, a certified financial planner with Compass Planning Associates.

Consider: A 30-year-old earning $100,000 a year will gross $3.5 million over the course of their working years, according to Katz. And if that money cannot be earned due to sickness or injury, the potential for financial failure rises greatly. ""Without income, one cannot spend, save, invest or donate,"" he says.

How much to purchase

In general, insurance companies limit the amount of coverage to replace income. Policies typically provide about 66 percent of gross wages. According to Katz, the right benefit amount to purchase is straightforward. ""It would be any portion of your current paycheck, including commissions and bonus, not covered by your employer's benefit plan,"" he says.

If you have an employer-sponsored plan, learn what it covers as well as the definition of what ""covered earnings"" is, says Katz. Determine, too, what percentage of your earnings is covered as well as the monthly cap. Check whether income you receive from your disability income insurance policy is taxable or not. Once you do all that, you should be able to design a plan to ""fill the income gap"" of your current earnings not covered by your employer plan, says Katz.

If your employer doesn't offer a disability income insurance plan, your personal policy should seek to cover as much of your income as possible, says Katz.

The definition of disability

There are many definitions of disability, including own-occupation, modified own-occupation, any-occupation, and modified any-occupation.

The definition is the most critical issue to address when considering an insurance purchase, says Lynch of The American College of Financial Services. ""The 'gold standard' is called 'own occupation - cancellable,'"" he says. ""This policy basically guarantees that once issued, as long as you pay your premiums, which cannot be increased, your policy will remain in effect.""

According to Lynch, ""own-occupation"" means you will be considered disabled if you are unable to perform each and every responsibility of your current position.

By contrast, the more common definition found in policies is ""any-occupation,"" says Lynch, which says you are disabled only if you are unable to perform the responsibilities of any occupation, he says. ""By that definition, the vast majority of working Americans would never be considered disabled.""

Katz also says finding a contract that offers a ""partial"" benefit is very important under definitions. A ""partial"" benefit, he says, will pay you if you cannot work and suffer a loss of income as a result of being unable to perform at prior capacity because of injury or illness.

How to choose an elimination period

The elimination, or waiting period, is the stretch of time - typically 30 days to one year -- you have to wait before receiving income from your disability insurance plan. According to Katz, choosing an elimination period comes down to two issues: How many days of income are you able to cover from your personal resources. And cost.

""The longer you extend your waiting period, the lower your premiums will be,"" Katz says. ""The sweet spot for most plans is generally around 90 days.""

Equally important, purchase a plan that pays benefits for as long a period as possible - five years, 10 years, to age 67, or lifetime.

""Coordinating your elimination period and benefit payment period should be customized based on your financial profile and the other components of the long-term disability insurance plan to protect as much of your earnings as possible, for as long as possible,"" says Katz.

What else to consider?

You have to medically qualify for disability income insurance. ""So, the younger you are, the better the chances of being unsuccessfully underwritten,"" says Lynch.

Katz also notes that today's long-term disability plans protect many attributes of one's personal and business economy. ""Plans and plan riders are available to cover student loans, retirement plan contributions, business overhead expenses, business buy/sell arrangements, inflation riders and catastrophic coverage as example.

3 reasons millennials should consider a robo-advisor - us news,http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2016-04-07/3-reasons-millennials-should-consider-a-robo-advisor,"Robo-advisors may be perfect for a generation that often prefers digital interaction over human interaction.

The millennial market has long been the toughest nut to crack in the financial advisory sector. A Merrill Lynch survey that polled 153 investors between ages 18 and 35 in 2013 found that millennials have been reluctant to start relationships with investment professionals, whom they tend to view as ""salesmen.""

It doesn't help that the average millennial is low-income, low-net-worth and generally of low interest to wealth advisors in the first place.

But that lack of participation could be changing with the advent of robo-advisors. Since 2008, these automated wealth management services have provided algorithm-based investment advice without human interaction - perfect for a generation that often prefers digital interaction over face-to-face.

[See: 10 Ways Millennials Are Changing Homebuying.]

The services robo-advisors offer are also much less expensive than those of traditional financial advisors, which makes them a desirable option for young investors looking to build a nest egg. Here are three reasons millennials should consider robo-advisors.

Robo-advisors have low minimum investments. Traditional financial advisors provide customized, personal advice - but at a cost. Many will only take on clients with a net worth of $250,000 or more, which excludes most millennials just starting their careers.

Robo-advisors, on the other hand, require low minimum balances to invest. Some, like online investment advisor Betterment, have no minimum balance requirement and tailor their services to beginning investors, and some lower their fees as investments grow.

By providing a small barrier to entry, robo-advisors make investing more accessible to millennials. ""When you don't have $1 million to invest, you don't need anything more fancy than what someone like Wealthfront or Betterment is offering,"" says certified financial planner Pamela Capalad of Brunch and Budget, a financial planning firm based in New York City.

Robo-advisors charge smaller fees. Because robo-advisors use passive investing instead of the active investing used by many traditional financial advisors, they can afford to charge smaller fees than the big guys. Active investing is when an advisor or fund manager tries to choose investments that will beat the market. With passive investing, an advisor chooses a fund, such as an index fund that tracks the stocks of the S&P 500 index, as a benchmark for investing.

[See: 12 Millennial-Inspired Ways to Spend Less.]

While a traditional financial advisor may charge fees of 1 percent or higher, many popular robo-advisors charge 0.5 percent or less. That difference can save an investor a significant amount over the life of an investment.

Robo-advisors automatically rebalance your investments. Robo-advisors offer a hands-off approach by automatically rebalancing their customers' portfolios so they stay diversified and don't hold too many assets in one investment category. This can be a draw for millennials who don't want to worry about rebalancing their investments manually or hiring a financial advisor to do it for them. For a busy young person still trying to wrap their head around the ins and outs of investing, this can be a lifesaver.

Austin Lewis, a certified financial planner with Rooted Financial Planning in Fort Worth, Texas, says automation is one of his favorite things about robo-advisors.

""Automated investment management is nice ... but automated savings is even better,"" he says. ""The hardest part of accumulating wealth is saving money. When you link your bank account to a robo and choose your automatic savings schedule [which can be changed at any time], you just eliminated the hardest part to accumulating wealth. This single behavior will get you on the path to build wealth.""

Top robo-advisors for millennials. Due to the rapid proliferation of robo-advisors, there are many options for millennials looking for investing help. When choosing a firm, look at the fees it charges and the minimum balance required to invest. Remember that fees can take a big chunk out of your earnings, so examine how much you can contribute regularly and where you can find the lowest fees.

""Robo-advisors are good for millennials ... given that there is not much of a choice out there for quality advice to young people, as most advisors focus on older, more-established clients that already have assets,"" says certified financial planner Jeremy E. Portnoff of Portnoff Financial LLC in Woodbridge, New Jersey.",2016-04-07,3 reasons millennials should consider a robo-advisor - us news,3 Reasons Millennials Should Consider a Robo-Advisor - US News,"['Should', 'Consider']",['a Robo-Advisor - US News'],"['millennials', 'consider']",1.0
